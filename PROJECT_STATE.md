## Toolkit

**claude-code-toolkit v4.1.0** (`038f247f`), synced 2026-09-21 — **recorded in the same PR as the sync**. Manifest is **v4**: `CLAUDE.md` is template-owned and byte-identical, project content lives in `.claude/project-instructions.md`, agent tool extensions in `.claude/agent-grants.json`.

> **Record the sync in the same PR as the sync.** This line went stale three times — after #142/#143, #144/#145, and #147/#148 — because the sync and its record were separate commits. `template_verify` cannot catch it: `PROJECT_STATE.md` is `once`-class project prose and sits outside every one of its checks. Writing the habit down was not enough on its own; **v4.1.0 is the first sync where the record ships in the same commit**, which is the only thing that has ever actually closed it.

### v4.1.0 — manifest v3 → v4, and where project content lives now

`CLAUDE.md` is now **template-owned and byte-identical to the rendered template**, for everyone including the PO. It is no longer an editable file. The 1692-byte PROJECT-CUSTOM region moved verbatim into **`.claude/project-instructions.md`** (`once`-class, ours permanently, imported by `CLAUDE.md`'s last line `@.claude/project-instructions.md`). Delivery is at **session start** — a new or edited version is picked up at the NEXT session start, not the current one.

**`hooks/deny-claude-md-writes.sh` is the mechanism that replaces discipline.** Measured here on the installed hook, 12 synthetic payloads under Git Bash: root `CLAUDE.md` via all four editing tools → deny (2); `docs/CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/project-instructions.md`, a missing `file_path`, and a `Bash` payload → allow (0); **garbage stdin and empty stdin → deny (2)**, so it fails closed. An unparseable manifest or a missing JSON parser also exits 2. *"Survives `bypassPermissions`" is upstream's claim and is NOT measured here* — it is the load-bearing half of the argument, so it is recorded as unverified rather than restated as fact. **Stated non-goal, confirmed against the code:** it dispatches on `tool_name` only, so a `Bash` payload carrying `sed -i s/a/b/ CLAUDE.md` exits 0. The backstop is the next sync's `claude_md_identical` FAIL plus overwrite — a hand-edit is loud and self-healing instead of a permanent silent deviation, which is exactly the failure this project had under the v2 keep-mine model.

**`.claude/rules/project.md` had to be hand-corrected, and that is the `once`-class trap firing for real.** Both its "always-on rules belong in ..." sentences still named `CLAUDE.md`'s PROJECT-CUSTOM region — a region this release deletes, in a file `deny-claude-md-writes.sh` now refuses writes to. The file is **unscoped**, so it loads at EVERY session start at `CLAUDE.md` priority: every future session would have been handed an always-on instruction pointing somewhere nonexistent and write-denied. Upstream corrected its own seed in v4.1.0 (`templates/python/.claude/rules/project.md:19` now names `.claude/project-instructions.md`), but the file is `once`-class, so **that correction can never arrive by sync** — it had to be made by hand, and this PR was the only moment it would have been noticed. Found by the `code-reviewer` pass, which is the first one a template-sync PR has had in five releases.

**`project_md_seed_current` reported INFO "seed is current" while our seed was demonstrably stale** — line 19 differed from the shipped seed in exactly the way R-G was written to surface. R-G predicts an un-migrated consumer reads "older"; we read "current" *after* migrating, with a stale line. A false green on the one check pointed at this drift. Reported upstream.

**Defect #17 (upstream v4.1.1) was avoided here by SEQUENCING, not by remediation.** `migrate_v3_to_v4` stores current-template hashes for template-owned files it does not write, so a consumer who migrates first sees `.claude/settings.json`, `AGENT_TEAM.md` and `hooks/enforce-delegation.sh` reported as `LOCAL_EDITED` with `template_changed: false` — genuine template updates wearing a local-edit label, and "keep mine" on that label would freeze v4.0.3 content for the enforcement wiring. The skill's own v3-window rule avoids it: **"sync everything else, migrate, then `CLAUDE.md` applies."** Applying those three while still honestly labelled `TEMPLATE_UPDATED` meant the migration stored hashes over a disk that already held that content. Verified by hash equality before migrating, not assumed:

| path | apply result | previewed v4 manifest | post-migration status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.claude/settings.json` | `66f45cfd…` | `66f45cfd…` | IDENTICAL |
| `AGENT_TEAM.md` | `048a7245…` | `048a7245…` | IDENTICAL |
| `hooks/enforce-delegation.sh` | `b0f03feb…` | `b0f03feb…` | IDENTICAL |

`local_edited` was **0** immediately after `migrated: true`. Upstream's remediation (re-apply all three with `backup_dir` in I2 order) is for a consumer who migrated first; the ordering fix is strictly better and costs nothing.

**The migration refusal paths did not apply**, both checked before writing: `out_of_region_diff` was empty (our `CLAUDE.md` was byte-identical to the synced template outside the region) and `.claude/project-instructions.md` did not exist. Either one would have refused with nothing written.

- **`region.sh --body` emits one more trailing newline than the migration's stored body.** A byte-compare of the captured region against `project-instructions.md` fails by exactly one `\n` on a *correct* migration — the extractor's own trailing newline, not project content. Every content byte survived; all five paragraphs plus the team-config line verified present. Same off-by-one family as `region_bytes` reporting 1693 where `--body` reports 1692.
- **`migration_required` is a v2-only field and reads `false` on a current server.** Measured here on 4.1.0 @ `038f247` *in the same call* where `template_verify` FAILed `status_clean` with `MIGRATION_REQUIRED`. Two fields, one response, opposite answers. `registered_tools` containing `template_migrate_manifest` is likewise necessary but not sufficient — v4.0.x already registered it. The only honest step-0 gate is `server_commit` == toolkit HEAD, then `template_verify`.
- **The `2 0 0` probe self-blocked again**, this time via `gate-before-merge.sh` rather than `no-push-main`: `Gate artifact expired (156461s old, max 3600s)`. Past both the TTL and the 24 h tree+env window, so it correctly refused instead of accepting on tree identity. Per the skill's own rule that is the positive result. Arm (a) — `bash -n` over all 17 scripts, 0 failures — is the arm that still carries information.
- **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` lost its `"reason": "Project-specific config"` annotation** in the v3 → v4 rewrite, reported in no field: `unknown_keys`, `unknown_file_keys` and `superseded_keys_dropped` were all empty. Harmless here (descriptive prose, not a resolution), but it is a silent drop and is reported upstream.

### v4.0.3 — what changed here

Five enforcement files: `hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh`, `gate-before-merge.sh`, `no-push-main.sh`, `pre-commit-test.sh`, `run-gate.sh`. Toolkit HEAD was seven docs-only commits past the tag; tracked-tree diff verified clean, so step 1b case 2 — `template_commit 150627de`, `template_version v4.0.3`.

- **Guard hooks now read a script argument's first 16 KB.** A git verb inside a script is gated exactly as if typed. Measured here two-sided, and the instrument is the tree-keyed gate record, not `cmd_len`:

  | arm | body | gate record |
  |---|---|---|
  | control | no git verb | `elapsed` UNCHANGED at 178 — no Gate ran |
  | test | `false && git commit -m unreachable` | `elapsed` 63 — fresh Gate run |

  The verb is present as text but unreachable, so nothing executes; the guard reads it regardless. **`cmd_len` on `last-precommit-noop` cannot be used as the instrument**: the PreToolUse hook writes that record *before* the command runs, so any call that reads it reads its own record (observed drifting 489 → 400 → 883 purely from inspection commands). The tree-keyed record is safe because only commit-segment commands write it.

- **Consequence for probes.** The skill's standing "put the probe in a script file" remedy no longer hides git verbs from the guard, so the routine `2 0 0` `no-push-main` probe self-blocks from inside a session. Per the skill's own rule that is the positive result, not a failure; the `2 0 0` line is retired from the report format in toolkit v4.0.4. Do not reach for a wrapper script or a runtime-assembled verb to "pass" it — those are the bypass class `deny-secret-reads` exists to prevent.

- **The 24 h tree+env artifact acceptance fired for real** on the #147 merge: the artifact was 2.5 h old, well past the 3600 s TTL, sha and tree both matching HEAD, and the merge was allowed on tree identity across a reboot. The commit message for #147 says that arm was "not exercised by this sync" — it was exercised minutes later, by the merge.

### v4.0.2 — what changed here

- **`require-skills-block.sh` now fails closed.** It guards on `tool_name` and refuses an Agent payload carrying no `tool_input.prompt`. Verified two-sided on the installed hook: Agent-without-prompt → exit 2, Bash payload → exit 0. The second arm is the one that matters — a guard refusing everything passes the positive arm identically to one that works.
- **`post-edit-build.sh` treats a literal `None` as `none`.** No effect here; panoscribe declares lowercase `none`. The behaviour change is measured at the toolkit end (`test-hooks.sh` fixture pair, pre-fix failure reproduced by reversion), not on this tree.
- **Adopted the v4.0.2 `.claude/rules/project.md` seed.** It carries the sentence this project's own measurement produced — a new or edited rules file is picked up at the NEXT session start — plus a worked `paths:` frontmatter example the hand-written header lacked.
- **`registered_tools`** joins `capabilities` in the load response, and it is the stronger instrument: `capabilities` says what the loaded modules support, `registered_tools` says what the process can actually dispatch. A pre-release server once advertised `template_verify` with a nine-tool registry.

### v4.0.1 — what changed here

- **Legacy version labels gone.** `lastSyncedVersion`/`lastSyncedVersionOf` were client-stamped by the old skill step 7b and duplicated the server-written `template_version`/`template_commit`. Step 7b is deleted upstream, so `superseded_keys_dropped` removed them for good rather than re-adding them next sync. `unknown_keys` is now empty.
- **Gate artifacts moved** to `<common git dir>/gate/last-pass.<sha>.json` — shared across worktrees, and inside `.git`, so no longer a working-tree object `git add -A` could sweep up. The three legacy `.gate/` files were removed **by name** after checking `**Log Path**`; another consumer had 585 KB of unrecoverable logs behind the same instruction when it said to delete the directory.
- **`**Gate Command**` renamed to `**Gate**`.** v4.0.1 normalised `Gate` and `Test` to the short spelling while keeping `Build`/`Format`/`Lint Command` long. The hooks accept both; the rename cleared the one `template_verify` FAIL (`declared_keys: deprecated_spelling`). **Do not** shorten Build/Format/Lint — the template declares those long, and renaming creates the same mismatch in the other direction.

**CORRECTION carried in #143:** the long-standing note that `**Test**: none` is eval'd as a command and blocks every commit is **wrong, and has been since toolkit v3.0.3**. `hooks/pre-commit-test.sh` treats a trimmed, case-insensitive `none` as *not declared* and falls through to the Gate — identical to absent. It came from the template's own stale comment, which is `once`-class here and so would never have self-corrected. `**Test**` stays absent because absent is unambiguous, not because `none` is unsafe.

**Rules-file delivery, measured 2026-09-17.** An *unscoped* `.claude/rules/*.md` (no `paths:` key) IS delivered to every subagent at spawn, with full content, at `CLAUDE.md` priority — `.claude/rules/project.md` arrives; `python.md` (scoped `**/*.py`) does not. But a rules file **created or edited mid-session does not reach a subagent spawned later in that session** — measured twice, untracked and staged, so index-tracked-ness is not the gate. Whether the gate is "committed to HEAD" or "present at session start" is unresolved. Practical rule: after touching a rules file, assume nothing reads it until the next session.

### v4.0.0 — manifest v2 → v3 ownership classes

Three `keep-mine` resolutions were dropped by the migration. A dropped resolution is a loss **only when the incoming class is weaker**:

| Path | Incoming class | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` | `once` | **Stronger** than `keep-mine` — never overwritten again |
| `PROJECT_STATE.md` | `once` | **Stronger** |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `template` | The only real one; resolved by **accepting the template** |

`CLAUDE.md`'s two out-of-region deviations were both superseded by v4.0.0 (it ships the single-entry-point Quick Start and an equivalent Required-Skills sentence). The PROJECT-CUSTOM region is preserved by the region mechanism, independently of ownership class. **[Superseded by v4.1.0]** — for `CLAUDE.md` that region no longer exists; the region mechanism still applies to `AGENT_TEAM.md` and the seven agent files, which keep theirs.

`CLAUDE.local.md` is now **project-owned** — dropped from manifest tracking as project-class, untouched on disk.

**`once` cuts both ways.** A `once` file is never clobbered and, by the same mechanism, never re-diffed — so template-side *additions* never arrive. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` therefore keeps the `**Gate Command**` / `**Test Command**` spellings (the hooks still accept both) and will **not** receive the newly declared `**Gate-checked branches**`, `**PO write surface**` or `**Post-edit build**` keys without a hand edit. `**Gate-checked branches**` is the one with teeth: its absence is why `gate-before-merge.sh`'s gate-checked arm has never once fired here.

**`.claude/rules/project.md` loads at launch.** A rules file with no `paths:` key is delivered at every session start at `CLAUDE.md` priority — only `paths:`-scoped ones are lazy. The migration wrote a diff of `CLAUDE.md`'s out-of-region hunks there on the opposite assumption; the body was replaced with an inert note in #141, and the always-on rules stayed in `CLAUDE.md`'s PROJECT-CUSTOM region as the single source. Fixed upstream in toolkit v4.0.1. **[Superseded by v4.1.0]** — the single source is now `.claude/project-instructions.md`; `.claude/rules/project.md` was hand-repointed at it in #149, since a `once`-class file can never receive that correction by sync.

The v3.0.0 consolidation retired three agents — **spawn the successor, not the retired name**:

| Retired | Spawn instead | Why it is safe |
|---|---|---|
| `requirements-engineer` | `architect` | absorbed it; carries `brainstorming` (`AGENT_TEAM.md:405`, PO routing at `:65`) |
| `test-writer` | `tester` | absorbed it; carries `test-driven-development` (`:404`) |
| `doc-generator` | `coder` | absorbed it |

Absorb, not rename — the survivors gained the skills, so no capability was lost. Seven agent files remain.

**Deviation tracking is now the ownership class, not a hand-kept list.** Under manifest v3 the old "permanent deviations" list (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`) is obsolete: `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md` are `once` (kept by the class, no annotation needed), and `CLAUDE.md` is `template` with its project content held in the PROJECT-CUSTOM region **[Superseded by v4.1.0]** — `CLAUDE.md` is still `template`-class, but it now holds no project content at all: that content lives in `.claude/project-instructions.md`, and `hooks/deny-claude-md-writes.sh` refuses writes to `CLAUDE.md` outright. `hooks/run-gate.sh` left the old list back in PR #131 — the #98 pytest-cov preflight moved out to repo-root `preflight.sh`, wired through the **Gate Command** under the toolkit's terminal contract, so the hook is byte-identical to the template and auto-updates.

`preflight.sh` itself stays project-owned at the repo root and is **not** manifest-tracked: it runs as the first command of the Gate Command precisely so it does not have to live inside `hooks/run-gate.sh`, which syncs verbatim and would force a hand-merge on every release.
