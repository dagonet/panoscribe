# deny-claude-md-writes.sh — PreToolUse hook: under a manifest v4 consumer,
# the repo-root CLAUDE.md is template-owned and the next sync overwrites it.
#
# Matcher: Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit
#
# v4.1 (spec docs/plans/2026-09-18-v4.1-design.md §6). Manifest v4 moves the
# project's own instructions out of CLAUDE.md's PROJECT-CUSTOM region and into
# `.claude/project-instructions.md` (a once-class file the sync server never
# overwrites). CLAUDE.md itself becomes template-owned: every sync replaces it
# wholesale. This hook is the mechanical half of that contract — a PO or agent
# who edits the root CLAUDE.md anyway loses the edit silently at the next
# sync, and this hook turns that into an immediate, explained refusal instead.
#
# DECISION RULE, AND ITS POLARITY (fail-CLOSED on cannot-determine):
#   tool_name not Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit  -> exit 0 (nothing to
#     read — the matcher already excludes other tools; this hook must never
#     deny on a call shape it cannot inspect)
#   path field absent/empty                          -> exit 0
#   normalised path != <root>/CLAUDE.md               -> exit 0 (a nested
#     CLAUDE.md, e.g. docs/CLAUDE.md, is not this hook's business)
#   no <root>/.claude/template-manifest.json          -> exit 0 (pre-v4
#     consumer, or the toolkit's own checkout — no manifest, no rule)
#   manifest present but its JSON does not parse      -> exit 2 (CANNOT
#     DETERMINE the version, so this hook refuses rather than guess allow —
#     the gate-design rule: a check that cannot answer must not clear the
#     call it cannot read)
#   manifest_version == 4                             -> exit 2 (DENY, the
#     message below)
#   manifest_version == 3, or anything else parseable -> exit 0 (allow —
#     manifest v3 has no `.claude/project-instructions.md` yet; the region in
#     CLAUDE.md is still the PO's legitimate surface)
#   no JSON parser on PATH / unparsable stdin          -> exit 2 (same
#     fail-closed posture as hooks/deny-secret-reads.sh: a call this hook
#     cannot inspect is not one it can clear)
#
# TWO HOOKS, ONE PATH (plan ruling R-L). hooks/enforce-delegation.sh keeps
# CLAUDE.md on the PO's main-thread write surface — under a v3 manifest that
# is still correct, the PROJECT-CUSTOM region lives there. Under a v4
# manifest the two project-level PreToolUse hooks disagree on the same path:
# enforce-delegation.sh's allow-side message still names CLAUDE.md; THIS hook
# denies. Both are registered; Claude Code runs every matching PreToolUse
# hook and a single "deny" wins over any "allow", so the deny always fires
# first in effect regardless of hook order. enforce-delegation.sh's comment,
# --help text and deny message were updated (R-L) to say CLAUDE.md is on the
# surface "pre-v4 manifests only", so its allow-side text stops teaching
# something false once a consumer migrates.
#
# SCOPE (spec §6, reviewer D5): this is a guardrail on the editing TOOLS, not
# a filesystem boundary. A Bash write (`sed -i CLAUDE.md`, `>> CLAUDE.md`, a
# heredoc) is not seen by this hook at all — deny-secret-reads.sh's Bash arm
# has a verb model for exactly this reason, and this hook does not reuse it,
# because unlike a secret a rewritten CLAUDE.md is not exfiltration; it is
# simply undone by the next sync. Never described as "CLAUDE.md cannot be
# written" — only that the editing tools refuse it and say where to write
# instead.
#
# REGISTRATION SCOPE: project-level only. Registered in every template's
# `.claude/settings.json`; NOT mirrored into `user-level-reference/hooks/`
# and NEVER registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` (HOOKS_NO_MIRROR in
# scripts/verify-template-consistency.sh carries the reason) — a user-level
# copy would refuse CLAUDE.md writes in every non-consumer repo on the
# machine, including this toolkit's own checkout and every project that has
# never run `/sync-template` at all.
#
# PATH NORMALISATION. hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh has no public repo-root helper (its
# gccc_norm is an internal two-letter-prefixed helper local to the -C
# resolver, and it only maps backslash -> forward slash — no drive-letter
# case fold), so this hook resolves the root directly with `git -C`, the same
# call hooks/enforce-delegation.sh already makes at its own line 292. dcm_norm
# below is the ONE normaliser for the payload path, the payload cwd AND the
# root (v4.1.1 #23) — relatives resolve against the normalised CWD, not the
# root (the pre-existing bug: cwd=<root>/docs + file_path=CLAUDE.md used to
# join against the ROOT and deny docs/CLAUDE.md, out of this hook's own
# stated scope). It folds backslash -> forward slash, the MSYS single-letter
# form (`/g/...`) -> drive form (`g:/...` — a real payload and a `git
# rev-parse --show-toplevel` result are known to disagree exactly here),
# collapses `.`/`..` segments (pure sh, no `realpath`: the path need not
# exist), and on MSYS/MinGW/Cygwin lower-cases the WHOLE path (Windows
# filesystem semantics — `claude.md` and `CLAUDE.md` name the same file, not
# only the drive letter).
#
# BASENAME PRE-FILTER (v4.1.1 #24). Measured ~634 ms per editing call before
# this: json_have/json_valid/json_get each probe/spawn node, python3 or jq —
# four interpreter spawns on EVERY Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit, whether
# or not the path is anywhere near CLAUDE.md. dcm_pre_path below reads the
# raw file_path/notebook_path value with grep ALONE (the same "has to work
# with no parser at all" reasoning as json_session, hooks/lib/json.sh) and a
# loose case-insensitive "ends in claude.md" check — deliberately not the
# brief's four-shape enumeration (slash/backslash x case), which has no
# case-insensitive-backslash member and so misses `C:\proj\claude.md`; a
# plain suffix check cannot have that gap, because it does not enumerate
# separators at all. False positives here (a real file that merely ends in
# "claude.md") just fall through to the precise check below, at the cost of
# one wasted parse — never a correctness issue. A payload whose path does
# not end in "claude.md" exits 0 here, before lib/json.sh's json_have ever
# runs, with no node/python3/jq spawned.

# Fix round 1 (Class B): the single-drive-letter MSYS fold (`/c/...` ->
# `c:/...`) only covers ONE MSYS mount shape. Git Bash's own `/tmp` is a
# DIFFERENT, named mount (`/tmp/xyz` -> `C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Local/
# Temp/xyz`, measured on this box) that the single-letter regex cannot
# express -- test-hooks.sh's own fixtures build their throwaway repos under
# system `mktemp -d`, which resolves under exactly this mount, so EVERY #23
# fixture's cwd/file_path silently failed to normalise to the same string
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns (always drive-letter form) and the
# comparison always missed. `cygpath -m` (already this file's second choice
# behind nothing -- test-hooks.sh's own `natpath` helper uses it for the same
# reason) understands every MSYS mount, not only the drive-letter ones, and
# is a pure lexical/mount-table rewrite -- confirmed on a non-existent path,
# so it does not violate "the normaliser must not require the path to
# exist". Applied ONLY to a string that already starts with `/`: a RELATIVE
# input (`./CLAUDE.md`, `docs/../CLAUDE.md`) must not be handed to `cygpath`
# before it is joined with the payload's own cwd, or it resolves against
# the HOOK PROCESS's cwd instead -- wrong base entirely. The single-letter
# regex stays as the fallback for a host with no `cygpath` (plain WSL/Linux).
