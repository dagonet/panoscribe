# PreToolUse hook: refuse to read a secret-bearing .env file.
#
# Matcher: Read|Bash
#
# WHY A HOOK AND NOT A DENY RULE (v3.0.3, queue item 28, measured from a
# consumer screenshot 2026-09-04). Six `Read(.env…)` entries used to sit in
# `permissions.deny` of every template `.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code
# evaluates deny rules BEFORE the auto-mode classifier, and a read-only command
# whose path is RELATIVE after a `cd` cannot be statically proven not to be a
# denied path — so the harness prompts ("a Read() deny rule is configured; only
# you can approve running it anyway") and auto mode cannot approve it. Subagents
# working in worktrees run `cd <worktree> && grep …` on nearly every read, so
# every "auto mode is prompting" report this cycle traced back to those six
# lines. A HOOK deny does not trigger the static path check: the hook sees the
# resolved call and answers per call. The protection is kept; the prompt is not.
#
# DECISION RULE
#   Read  : tool_input.file_path matches the secret shape          -> exit 2
#   Bash  : the command contains a READER VERB *and* a token that
#           matches the secret shape                               -> exit 2
#   anything else                                                  -> exit 0
#
# Secret shape: `(^|/)\.env(\.<suffix>)?$`, except a basename of exactly
# `.env.example` — that file is the documented placeholder list most repos
# track, and denying it was v2.2.0's BUG 6 (check 22b in
# verify-template-consistency.sh has guarded it ever since).
#
# WHY THE BASH ARM NEEDS A READER VERB, stated because the two obvious rules
# disagree: "any argv token that looks like a .env path" makes `echo .env` a
# denial, and `echo .env` is not a read — it is a literal, and the plan's own
# fixture list wants it allowed. Keying on the verb resolves that in the
# direction the fixtures state, and it keeps `git show HEAD:.env` out of this
# hook's jurisdiction for the right reason rather than by accident of the
# regex.
#
# v3.0.3 defect 2 — FOUR MEASURED HOLES INSIDE THE VERB MODEL, and the rule
# that was NOT adopted. A consumer measured `rev .env`, `dd if=.env`,
# `cp .env /dev/stdout` and `cat .e*v` all returning 0, and proposed re-keying
# the hook on "any argv token that names a secrets file, regardless of verb".
# That is the inverse rule this file's next paragraph already considered and
# REJECTED, for the reason stated there. It stays rejected. The holes are
# closed INSIDE the verb model instead:
#
#   1. `rev` was simply missing from the reader list. Added — the paragraph
#      below says adding verbs is cheap and safe, and this is that gap.
#   2. `dd` was already listed; the miss was the OPERAND SHAPE. `if=.env` is a
#      `key=value` token, not a bare path. Operands under a listed verb are now
#      also read out of `key=value`, but ONLY for INPUT-shaped keys (`if`, and
#      any key ending in `file`, `input` or `in`). Restricting the key list is
#      what keeps `grep -r ENV --exclude=.env .` allowed: `--exclude` is an
#      exclusion, not a read. STATED BLIND SPOT: an exotic input option whose
#      key is not on that list.
#   3. A COPY verb turned reader by its DESTINATION. `cp .env /dev/stdout`
#      copies the secret into the transcript. The copy class (`cp`, `install`,
#      `rsync`; `dd` and `tee` are already readers) is denied ONLY when the
#      destination is `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/fd/1` or `/dev/stderr`. A copy to a
#      FILE stays allowed, because it is a write: `cp .env.example .env` and
#      `cp .env /tmp/backup` are 0, asserted.
#   4. TRANSMIT verbs — `curl -T/--upload-file/-d @/--data-binary @`, `scp`,
#      `wget --post-file=` — send the contents off the machine, which is the
#      outcome the six deleted deny rules existed to prevent. They are reads by
#      another name. The auto-mode classifier's exfiltration rules also cover
#      them; this is belt-and-braces, said out loud rather than assumed.
#
# GLOB HEURISTIC, AND IT IS A HEURISTIC. `cat .e*v` cannot be resolved by a hook
# that does not know the working directory's contents, so the shape is judged
# instead of the target: under a LISTED verb, a token whose basename starts with
# `.e` and contains `*`, `?` or `[` is treated as secret-shaped. It over-matches
# (`cat .exports*` is denied) and under-matches (`cat *env`, `cat ?env` are
# not). Both are accepted: the verb requirement keeps the blast radius to
# commands that were going to print a file anyway.
#
# CASE. The match is case-INSENSITIVE, because the filesystems this runs on are:
# `cat .ENV` reads the same bytes as `cat .env`.
#
# THE VERB LIST IS AN ALLOWLIST AND IS THEREFORE KNOWN-INCOMPLETE — SAID HERE
# rather than discovered later, the same way v3.0.2's clause blocklist declared
# its own incompleteness. A reader that is not in the list below passes: today
# that is anything from `perl -ne`, `busybox cat` under another name, or a
# consumer's own script. Adding verbs is cheap and safe; the inverse rule ("deny
# any matching token unless the verb is provably inert") was considered and
# REJECTED, because it denies `cp .env.example .env`, `git add .env` and
# `rm .env`, none of which are reads. A missed read is a gap; a denied write is
# a guard people switch off.
#
# STATED BLIND SPOT. This hook sees a command's ARGUMENTS, not what an
# interpreter opens. `python -c "open('.env')"`, `node -e "fs.readFileSync…"`
# and `git show HEAD:.env` are NOT denied here — they are judged by the
# auto-mode classifier's own credential rules. Two fixtures assert exactly that
# (want 0) so the boundary is a decision on the record, not an oversight.
#
# FAILS CLOSED on an unparseable payload or with no JSON parser on PATH, the
# same posture as the three git gates that already share this matcher: a hook
# that cannot see the call cannot clear it.
