#!/usr/bin/env bash
# enforce-delegation.sh — PreToolUse hook: the PO (main thread) never does
# hands-on work; sub-agents do all coding/building/testing.
#
# Matchers (two groups in settings.json):
#   Edit|Write|NotebookEdit  — deny main-thread edits outside the PO write surface
#   Bash                     — deny main-thread build/test-runner commands
#
# Discriminator: the hook stdin JSON contains `agent_id` ONLY when the call
# originates inside a subagent. agent_id present -> allow (subagents do the
# work). Absent -> main thread -> enforce.
#
# PO write surface (main-thread Edit/Write allowed): docs/plans/,
# PROJECT_STATE.md, PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, .claude/, CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md,
# AGENT_TEAM.md, and any path OUTSIDE the repo root (scratchpad, ~/.claude
# memory). Everything else (source code, tests, docs content) is agent work.
#
# v3.1: a project may extend this list without editing the hook -- the
# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md **PO write surface** key names extra path prefixes,
# space/comma-separated (docs/ tools/). `none` or an absent key adds nothing;
# an unfilled {{...}} placeholder is reported on stderr once and treated as
# none.
#
# Main-thread Bash: build/test runners (npm test, dotnet build, pytest,
# cargo test, playwright, mvn, gradle, go test) and hooks/run-gate.sh are
# denied — the coder runs the gate, the tester verifies, ops handles env
# work. The PO verifies via the .gate/last-pass.json artifact, never by
# running the suite. Evaluated per SEGMENT (split on && || ; & | newline);
# a segment whose first token is `git` or `gh` is EXEMPT — git/GitHub I/O is
# the PO's documented role (AGENT_TEAM.md), so `git add hooks/run-gate.sh`
# and `git commit -m "run pytest first"` pass, while `git add x && bash
# hooks/run-gate.sh` still denies on its second segment.
#
# Known limitations (both deliberate — this hook is fail-OPEN by contract):
#   * the split is quote-blind, so a separator INSIDE a quoted message
#     (`git commit -m "a; pytest -q"`) still splits and the tail is judged on
#     its own. Errs CLOSED, at parity with the pre-v2.1.5 whole-string match.
#     Pinned by a fixture.
#   * only `cd X` and `VAR=value` prefixes are stripped. Command wrappers —
#     `env VAR=x pytest`, `time pytest`, `nice pytest`, `xargs …` — are not,
#     so they pass. Errs OPEN, matching this hook's failure polarity: a
#     determined bypass is not the threat model, an accidental main-thread
#     `pytest` is.
#   * HEREDOC BODIES ARE STRIPPED before the split (v2.3.0), because a body is
#     data with an explicit terminator — `cat > plan.md <<EOF … npm test … EOF`
#     is authoring, not running. Quoted literals are NOT stripped: `bash -c
#     "npm test"` and `echo "npm test"` are the same syntactic shape, and
#     separating them needs a maintained wrapper allowlist whose every gap is a
#     new evasion channel. So `echo "npm test"` stays judged as written.
#
# THIS HOOK DOES NOT SOURCE hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. The
# three git gates there are fail-CLOSED and scan the whole command string on
# purpose, so `bash -c "git push origin main"` cannot evade them and a false
# positive on `echo "git push origin main"` costs one retry. Opposite polarity,
# opposite trade — do not "unify" the two by giving git-cmd.sh this stripping.
#
# Escape hatch: create `.claude/delegation-off` at the repo root to disable
# (also the fix if a pre-agent_id CLI ever denies subagent calls).
#
# FAILURE POLARITY — deliberately fail-OPEN:
#   * Do NOT wrap this hook with the exit-2-on-127 pattern. A missing script
#     would then block ALL Edit/Write INCLUDING subagents' — total paralysis
#     (same class as the SubagentStop stop-gate rule).
#   * Registration uses a WARN-wrapper instead: on 127 it prints a stderr
#     diagnostic ("delegation enforcement offline — run /sync-template") and
#     exits 0, so absence is visible but never blocking.
#   * Internal parse failures exit 0 (pass-through) — never block a subagent
#     on malformed stdin.

Usage: registered as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook (settings.json).
  Matcher "Edit|Write|NotebookEdit": denies main-thread edits outside the PO
  write surface (docs/plans/, PROJECT_STATE.md, PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, .claude/,
  CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, AGENT_TEAM.md, paths outside the repo, plus any
  prefixes named by PROJECT_CONTEXT.md's **PO write surface** key).
  Matcher "Bash": denies main-thread build/test-runner commands and
  hooks/run-gate.sh.
Subagent calls (stdin contains agent_id) always pass. Disable by creating
.claude/delegation-off at the repo root.
