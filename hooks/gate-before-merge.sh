# PreToolUse hook: block PR merge/auto-merge without a fresh gate artifact
# Matcher: Bash|PowerShell|mcp__MCP_DOCKER__merge_pull_request|mcp__github-tools__github_pr_auto_merge
#
# v2.0: `gh pr merge`, a `git merge` while on main/master, and a push that
# targets main/master (fast-forward merge by push) are gated too, because the
# native git/gh CLI is allowed again. The MCP branch is unchanged -- those are
# GitHub tools, not the retired git-tools server. Escape hatch:
# <cwd>/.claude/git-guard-off.
#
# v2.4.0 (A6): a merge initiated while the checkout is on a PROTECTED branch is
# refused outright, before the artifact is even read — on that topology the
# merge lands the other side's content, so no comparison against this
# checkout's HEAD can say anything about it. See the block above that check.
#
# QUALIFIER (v3.0.3): "refused outright" is true FOR REPOS WITH A GATE
# CONFIGURED. The `**Gate**:` lookup below exits 0 when the field is absent,
# BEFORE any protected-branch judgement — so **no Gate command configured means
# this hook exits 0 for every merge, on every branch.** Configure `**Gate**:` in
# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md to get merge protection. That is the contract and not a
# bug (a gate with no command has nothing to prove), but it is the reading
# people get wrong, so it is stated here rather than inferred from the code.
# There is deliberately no stderr notice: the harness drops non-blocking hook
# stderr, so it would be invisible to the person who needs it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# v3.0.1 — WHAT IS AND IS NOT GATED ON A PROTECTED BRANCH. Read this before
# reaching for the kill switch; it is the contract, and it lives HERE because
# this file syncs to consumers while docs/verification.md does not.
#
#   git merge --abort / --continue / --quit   ALLOWED, always. They land nothing
#       new, and a conflicted merge on a protected branch is exactly the state
#       this gate exists to worry about — you must be able to get out of it.
#   git merge <anything else>                 GATED, unconditionally.
#       v3.0.2 DELETED the catch-up exemption that allowed
#       `git merge --ff-only <this branch's upstream>` when HEAD was already an
#       ancestor of it. It resolved the ref by NAME and trusted its VALUE, and
#       `git update-ref refs/remotes/origin/main <sha>` is ungated — measured
#       landing never-gated content on a protected branch while every
#       configuration read came back honest. Proving the ref FRESH does not
#       work either: a reflog message is forgeable with `update-ref -m`, and a
#       fresh clone has no `.git/logs/refs/remotes/origin/main` at all, so a
#       freshness check fails closed on every new clone.
#       THE CATCH-UP ROUTE IS NOW `git pull --ff-only`, which is safe here
#       BECAUSE IT FETCHES FIRST: the fetch overwrites a poisoned tracking ref
#       before the merge reads it (measured).
#   git pull --ff-only   (no remote, no refspec)   ALLOWED only when this
#       branch's own config names it: `branch.<cur>.remote` is set AND
#       `branch.<cur>.merge` is `refs/heads/<cur>`. v3.0.2: "targets the
#       configured upstream by construction" was false — `branch.<cur>.merge`
#       is re-pointable, re-pointing is ungated, and `git pull --ff-only` then
#       landed a whole foreign branch on a protected branch.
#   git pull --ff-only <remote> <branch>      ALLOWED when <branch> is this
#       branch's name and neither operand carries a ':'. Strictly more provably
#       safe than the refspec-free form — it NAMES what it lands — and gated
#       until v3.0.2 purely because the form looked refspec-bearing.
#   git pull <any other form>                 GATED, including a bare `git pull`
#       on a branch that would fast-forward cleanly. That is deliberate: the
#       remedy is one word, and it is the safer command.
#   gh pr merge / the GitHub merge tools      GATED from a protected branch.
#
#   AND: any of the gated forms above is also refused when an EARLIER clause of
#       the SAME command checks out (or switches to) a protected branch, or a
#       target this hook cannot resolve. `git checkout main && git merge
#       feature/x` used to slip through — this hook runs before the command, so
#       it read the branch you were still on. Order is what matters, not
#       chaining: `gh pr merge …; git checkout main; git pull --ff-only` is fine,
#       the gated clause runs first. `git checkout feature/z && git merge …` is
#       fine too, because the target is not protected. Run the checkout and the
#       operation as separate calls, or name the destination — `git push origin
#       <branch>` keys on its argument and never consults the current branch.
#
#   AND (v3.0.2, REPLACED IN v3.0.3 BY AN ALLOWLIST): the same refusal when an
#       earlier clause of the same command could MOVE WHAT THE GATED CLAUSE
#       RESOLVES TO. v3.0.2 enumerated the ways (`git branch -u`, `git config
#       branch.*/remote.*`, `git update-ref`, …) and the enumeration did not
#       close — `git config include.path /x` and `cp rogue .git/config` both
#       walked past it. v3.0.3 inverts it into three categories:
#         inert   `echo`, `printf`, `ls`, `pwd`, `true`, and `git status |
#                 rev-parse | branch | log | diff | show` WITH read-only flags
#                 only. An inert clause is not scanned at all, so `git pull
#                 --ff-only && echo git pull --ff-only on main OK` is allowed.
#                 NOT inert: a redirection operand, any of the four command
#                 substitution forms (`$(`, backtick, `<(`, `>(`), a flag that
#                 is not on the verb's allowlist (`git diff --output=` CLOBBERS
#                 a file), or ANY clause when the command contains a pipe
#                 (`echo 'git merge x' | bash` EXECUTES it).
#         tracked `cd`, `git -C`, `git checkout|switch` — allowed because this
#                 gate FOLLOWS them and re-decides on where they land.
#         mover   everything else. Not refused on its own; it makes a LATER
#                 gated clause on a protected branch refuse.
#
#   AND (v3.0.2, WIDENED IN v3.0.3): the same refusal when the gated git
#       invocation ITSELF carries a global option that changes what it RESOLVES
#       to — `-c`, `--config-env`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree`, `--namespace`,
#       `--exec-path`, `--no-replace-objects`, an unknown global, or an
#       environment assignment before `git`. This needs no chaining at all: a
#       single `git -c remote.evil.url=… -c branch.main.remote=evil pull
#       --ff-only` was measured landing foreign content while
#       `branch.main.merge` on disk still read `refs/heads/main`. Allowed
#       globals: `-C <path>`, `--no-pager`, `-P`, `--paginate`,
#       `--no-optional-locks`, `--literal-pathspecs`, `--no-lazy-fetch`.
#
# THE STATED LIMIT: every decision above is taken BEFORE any fetch, so the
# CONTENT of a remote ref is unknown to this hook — it can only read the form of
# the command and refs that already exist locally. That is why `pull` is gated
# by form rather than by content: a remote-tracking ref that is merely STALE
# answers "adds nothing" confidently and wrongly about an object that is not the
# one the pull will land.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Requires .gate/last-pass.json (written by hooks/run-gate.sh) at the repo
# toplevel of the merging session's cwd — worktree-aware, since developer
# agents self-merge from their worktrees. Blocks (exit 2) unless:
#   - the artifact exists,
#   - its "sha" equals the current HEAD of that checkout OR its "tree" equals
#     that checkout's HEAD^{tree} — as of v2.1.5 "tree" is the WORKING tree at
#     gate time, so a commit of exactly what was gated (chained
#     `git add … && git commit`, or `git commit -a`) matches by tree even
#     though the artifact's sha is the parent commit's, and
#   - the artifact file is younger than 60 minutes (mtime).
#
# CONSEQUENCE, by construction, on a repo that commits straight to trunk: the
# artifact is STALE most of the time. Any commit moves HEAD and changes the
# tree — a docs-only commit included, because docs are tracked content — so both
# keys miss. That is correct. The artifact blesses one specific tree, that tree
# genuinely changed, and the gate cannot know which changes are harmless. The
# tree key was added in v2.1.5 to fix a different problem (the artifact's `sha`
# being the PARENT commit when an agent chains `git add … && git commit`), not
# to make an artifact outlive later commits. It costs nothing in practice: this
# gate only fires on merge-shaped commands, so staleness is invisible until an
# actual merge — at which point re-running the gate is exactly the requirement.
# Do NOT add a path-filtered or docs-excluding tree key to "fix" it: deciding
# which file changes are safe to skip is the judgement a gate must not make.
#

# `gh pr merge` is still gated, since that is a merge whatever the branch is.
# The payload is parsed through hooks/lib/json.sh (node, python3 or jq); with
# none of the three on PATH this gate fails CLOSED.

#
# v3.0.2 (measured minutes after v3.0.1 shipped): `git pull --ff-only 2>&1` was
# BLOCKED, reporting `refspec/remote named: present (2>&1 )`. `2>&1` starts with
# a digit, so the non-flag filter below counted it as an operand — an ordinary
# scripted form refused by a guard, which is how a layer gets switched off.
#
# THE STRIP MUST NOT BE GREEDY, and that is the whole difficulty. Dropping
# everything after a `>`, or every token that merely CONTAINS one, would turn
# `git pull origin feature/x 2>&1` into a refspec-free pull and hand it the
# safe-form exemption — reopening the hole A6 just closed. So it drops only
# tokens that are THEMSELVES a redirection operator:
#   - operator with its target attached (`2>&1`, `>file`, `>>file`, `<file`,
#     `&>file`): the one token goes;
#   - bare operator (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`, `&>`): the token AND the next one,
#     which is its target. Exactly one follower, never a run.
# A ref name can never match either pattern, because both require a `>` or `<`
# immediately after an optional fd number or `&`.
#
# The empty-token arm comes FIRST on purpose: `tr` emits an empty field for a

# v3.0.2 — A6.2's catch-up exemption is GONE. It lived here, and it allowed

#     -> never-gated content landed on the protected branch, and every
#        configuration read (branch.main.merge, main@{upstream}) stayed honest.
#
# THE EXEMPTION RESOLVED A REF BY NAME AND TRUSTED ITS VALUE. A name is not a
# value. And proving the value FRESH is not available to this hook: a reflog
# entry is forgeable (`git update-ref -m 'fetch origin: fast-forward'`), the log
# is a file that can be removed, and a FRESH CLONE HAS NO
# `.git/logs/refs/remotes/origin/main` at all — so a freshness check would fail
# closed on every new clone. Do not reintroduce either shape.
#
# No capability is lost: `git pull --ff-only` catches a protected branch up and
# SELF-HEALS, because the pull fetches before it merges — measured restoring a
# poisoned `origin/main` before reading it. That is now what the DENY message
# recommends.

# a6_pull_catchup <repo> <pull-args> -- true for the two pull forms that are

#
# v3.0.2, finding 54. The form this replaced allowed any refspec-free
# `--ff-only` pull, on the stated grounds that it "targets the configured
# upstream by construction". It does not: `branch.<cur>.merge` is re-pointable,
# and re-pointing is ungated on both gates.
#
#   git branch -u origin/rogue main    verdict 0   (ungated)
#   git pull --ff-only                 verdict 0   -> HEAD MOVED, rogue landed
#
# So compare NAMES — a local config read, offline, sound before the fetch:
#
#   refspec-free `--ff-only`   allowed only when `branch.<cur>.remote` is
#       non-empty AND `branch.<cur>.merge` is exactly `refs/heads/<cur>`.
#       Missing or mismatched is cannot-determine, so it gates.
#   `--ff-only <remote> <branch>`   allowed when there are exactly two operands,
#       neither carries a ':', and <branch> is the current branch. This form was
#       GATED until v3.0.2 and is strictly more provably safe than the one that
#       was allowed — it NAMES what it lands. A consumer reported the false
#       positive; the report's harmless half turned out to be the sound form.
#
# Operands are counted through a6_nonflag, which strips redirections first, so
# `git pull --ff-only origin main 2>&1` still reads as two operands and not
# three. That is the row where this rule and the v3.0.2 redirect strip meet.
#
# `config --get` is used, not `--get-all`: a multi-valued key makes it exit
# non-zero with no value, which lands in the mismatch arm and gates. That is the

# v3.0.3 item 2 — a6_clause_class replaces the a6_mutates_resolution BLOCKLIST.
#
# WHY THE BLOCKLIST HAD TO GO, in its own words: four resolution inputs
# (`branch.*.remote`, `branch.*.merge`, `remote.*.url`, `remote.*.fetch`) times
# at least four mutation channels (a git verb, a direct ref write, a
# `.git/config` file edit, env injection) — and the same channel behaves
# differently per key. The cell matters, not the row or the column, so no
# enumeration of keys and channels is sufficient. It missed
# `git config include.path /x` and `cp rogue .git/config`, both measured.
#
# THREE CATEGORIES, not two:
#   inert   never affects the gated clause. The arms are NOT RUN on it.
#   tracked allowed BECAUSE the scanner follows it: `cd`, `git -C`,
#           `git checkout|switch <target>`. `cd` is NOT inert — declaring it so
#           would switch OFF working machinery: `cd <protected repo> &&
#           git merge feature/x` from an unprotected cwd is 2 today, via
#           gc_cd_target/gc_resolve, and would flip to 0.
#   mover   everything else. The arms still run on it; if none fires, it sets
#           the `mutated` flag the pull/push arms read. This is what keeps the
#           gated clause itself — which is a `mover` by classification — from
#           being skipped, and what keeps a mover on a FEATURE branch from
#           being gated for no reason.
#
# WHY NOT SCANNING INSIDE AN INERT CLAUSE IS THE WHOLE POINT: the arms below
# grep UNANCHORED inside each segment, so `git pull --ff-only && echo git pull
# --ff-only on main OK` was refused — the echo body re-parsed as a second pull
# whose trailing words became a refspec. Running a command and then echoing what
# you ran is reflexive narration; an allowlist alone does not close it.
#
# AND WHY THE CATEGORY IS THIS NARROW. Three measured collisions:
#
#  (1) FOUR substitution forms. `$(`, a backtick, `<(` and `>(` can all execute
#      anything, and the last two carry neither `$` nor a backtick. All four are
#      refused today only because the arms see inside them; declaring the verb
#      inert without excluding all four would trade one false positive for four
#      real bypasses.
#
#  (2) NO CLAUSE IS INERT IN A COMMAND CONTAINING A PIPE (`|`, not `||`).
#      Measured, with paired controls:
#        echo 'git merge feature/x'          prints it   — the false positive
#        echo 'git merge feature/x' | bash   RUNS it     — a real merge
#      Identical leading verb, identical quoted content, opposite correct
#      verdicts, and the difference is what CONSUMES the clause's stdout, which
#      a per-clause classifier cannot see. The cheapest sound rule is the whole
#      command: a pipe anywhere and nothing is inert. `echo hello | bash` still
#      passes, because nothing in it is gated.
#
#  (3) AN INERT GIT VERB IS INERT ONLY WITH A FLAG ALLOWLIST — see
#      a6_inert_flags. `git diff HEAD~1 --output=.git/config` CLOBBERS
#      .git/config with NO shell operator in the clause, so the redirection rule
#      cannot see it: the redirection is an option VALUE. `git show --output=`
#      and `git log -p --output=` write files too, and
#      `git branch --set-upstream-to=` / `--unset-upstream` are the long forms
#      of the `-u` guard. Adding those to a guard list would be the third list
#      that does not close, so the allowlist is inverted the same way the argv
#      globals are: any flag not on the verb's list makes the clause a mover.
#
# THE MOVER RULE REFUSES WHEN THE VERDICT DEPENDS ON THE BRANCH THE MOVER LANDS
# ON — not whenever a mover is present. `git checkout main && git merge <x>` is
# refused: the landing is real and the branch decides. `git checkout main &&
# git pull --ff-only` is ALLOWED, because a bare `--ff-only` pull fetches first
# and can only fast-forward to the upstream, so it is judged the same on every
# branch; refusing it would be a denied legitimate command. It blocked on
# v3.0.2 and is allowed from v3.0.3 for that reason. Both polarities have rows.
#
# SETS TWO GLOBALS, does not print. A `$(a6_clause_class …)` call would run the
# body in a SUBSHELL and the reason string would never reach the DENY text — the
# refusal would then read as an ordinary merge refusal and the fixture asserting
# WHICH arm fired would pass on the wrong discriminator.

# `GIT_CONFIG_*` env prefix on the clause — not an enumeration of keys, because
# a new key cannot then silently join the list. Measured, ONE clause:
#
#   git -c remote.evil.url=<other> -c remote.evil.fetch=+refs/heads/*:… \

#
# The name comparison in a6_pull_catchup PASSES there — the merge ref is
# honest — and the content came from another remote entirely.
#
# THE HONEST COST: a benign `git -c core.pager=cat merge …` on a protected
# branch is now refused. That is the correct direction for a fail-closed gate,
# and the DENY message says to re-run without the `-c`.
#
# The `-c` search is restricted to the text BETWEEN `git` and the subcommand:
# gc_segments strips quotes, so a segment-wide grep would fire on
# `git merge -m "note -c x" feature/x` and refuse a message body.
# a6_is_git_sub is GONE (v3.0.3, finding 62). It existed because the lib's
# GC_GIT_PRE tolerated only `-C` and `-c`, so a clause carrying any other
# global did not match as a pull/push AT ALL and fell through UNGATED. The
# prefix is widened in the lib now — which is where the other two git gates
# read it from — so the local compensation is dead code and the arms below
# call gc_matches_subcommand directly.


# v3.0.3 item 1's classifier (gc_global_options) MOVED TO hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh
# as gc_global_options when finding 62 showed no-push-main.sh and
# pre-commit-test.sh need the identical classification. Same contract:
# `ok | refuse:<opt> | env:<VAR>`. One definition, three callers.

# gc_repo_for IS GONE (v3.0.3, defect 1 round 2). It held a private copy of the
# repeated-`-C` fold, on the stated grounds that fixing hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh
# would drag the ~90-minute three-parser matrix into this release. That reason
# was void — the lib already carries functional change in v3.0.3, so the matrix
# is already mandatory — and the private copy fixed THIS hook while leaving the
# same bypass live in hooks/no-push-main.sh, MEASURED at 0d7806e:
#
#   git -C <feature repo> -C <protected repo> push   from either cwd -> 0
#
# i.e. git lands on the protected branch and the push gate never sees it. The
# fold now lives in gc_repo_for; all three callers get it. See the comment
# there for the git 2.55.0 measurement of `-C` composition.

# intact 49 KB -> 1512 ms/call, the same logic with comments stripped 17 KB ->
# 1559 ms, a no-op script 38 ms. Stripping 32 KB changed nothing. The lever is
# not doing the work — the segment walk, gc_repo_for, gc_protected_branches,
# gc_on_main and their git subprocesses — on a command with no git or gh token
# in it at all. Every gated path in this file needs one of the two tokens
# below, so a payload carrying neither cannot reach a refusal.
#
# WHY THIS IS AFTER THE PARSE AND NOT BEFORE IT, measured. The obvious cheaper
# form is to grep the RAW JSON payload before sourcing anything. It is unsound:
# a newline inside the command is JSON-escaped as `\n`, so
# `"echo a\ngit merge feature/x"` puts the letter `n` immediately before `git`
# in the raw bytes, the `(^|[^[:alnum:]_-])` prefix fails, and the grep MISSES a
# genuinely gated merge — a FALSE NEGATIVE, i.e. an ungated exit 0, on exactly
# the newline-separated shape gc_segments exists to split. (Probed: the
# backslash-continuation, leading-tab, `&&` and `gh pr merge` forms are all
# seen; the newline one is not.) A false positive costs one wasted parse; a
# false negative costs the gate. So the token test reads GC_CMD, which is
# unescaped, and sits before the first git subprocess rather than before the
# parse.
#
# The MCP branch is untouched: those payloads carry no command string, and the
# GitHub merge tools are gated unconditionally.
#
# Note the test is for a git TOKEN, not for a leading `git merge`: after
# finding 62 a gated command can be `git -P merge feature/y`, and an early exit
# that pattern-matched on the subcommand would pass every timing test and
# re-open finding 62 in the same change — fast and wrong.

# INVARIANT — RE-CHECK IT BEFORE YOU ADD A GATED PATH (v3.0.2; penumbra).
#
# `git update-ref refs/remotes/origin/main <sha>` is UNGATED and stays so:
# the ways to MOVE a ref are unbounded, the ways to LAND content are few, so
# this gate protects the landing and never the ref. The property this file
# guarantees is therefore NOT "tracking refs are trustworthy". It is:
#
#   every path that acts on a remote-tracking ref on a protected branch is
#   gated UNCONDITIONALLY — its verdict never depends on the ref's VALUE.
#
# That is a property of the CONSUMER LIST, not of any one arm. The list is
# A6_CONSUMER_LIST below; test-hooks.sh's A6.11 census asserts the case arms
# in this file match it, and the A6.11 canary runs every form in FOUR ref
# states. If you add a gated path that RESOLVES a tracking ref and branches on
# what it finds — a new catch-up exemption, an "only if behind" shortcut, an
# "already up to date, nothing to gate" fast path, anything keyed on
# `rev-parse origin/X` — you have reopened ref poisoning, and NO EXISTING
# FIXTURE GOES RED except the canary, and only if you add the form to the
# list. The poisoning question is UNREACHABLE today, not ANSWERED.
# Before merging such a path:
#   (1) add its command form to A6_CONSUMER_LIST;
#   (2) the A6.11 canary then runs it in all four values of the pairwise
#       ancestry relation between HEAD and origin/main — BEHIND, EQUAL,
#       AHEAD, DIVERGED — and asserts the verdict AND the discriminator are
#       unchanged across all four. Four, not two: the v3.0.1 exemption keyed
#       on "HEAD is an ancestor of upstream", which is true for BEHIND and
#       EQUAL alike, and DIVERGED is the one people forget — "upstream is an
#       ancestor of HEAD" is true for AHEAD and false for DIVERGED, exactly
#       the shape a push-side shortcut would key on. WHAT THE FOUR STATES DO
#       AND DO NOT COVER, measured: the canary is asserted for every ancestry
#       predicate AND every value-equality predicate — EQUAL is one of the four
#       and the other three poison away from the honest value, so any
#       single-sha exemption gives a 1-vs-3 split whichever sha it keys on. It
#       is NOT asserted for predicates on commit CONTENT or METADATA that the
#       four fixture states share (author, message text, a file's presence):
#       the forged AHEAD/DIVERGED commits inherit those from the fixture;
#   (3) run delete-the-guard on that row: restore v3.0.1's exemption from git
#       and confirm the row goes red.
#
# ACCEPTED RESIDUAL, precisely: the name comparison in a6_pull_catchup reads
# branch.<cur>.merge ONLY. branch.<cur>.remote, remote.<r>.url and
# remote.<r>.fetch are NOT read, so a config write to one of those in a
# SEPARATE call, followed by a bare `git pull --ff-only`, passes with `merge`
# honest. Those are the reads that would close it, if anyone ever wants to.

    #
    # NO DISCRIMINATOR HERE, and that is a measured decision rather than a
    # shortcut. A pull FETCHES FIRST, so anything this hook resolves before the
    # command runs is an answer about a different object:
    #   - a CURRENT remote-tracking ref answers correctly (measured rc=0)
    #   - an ABSENT one is at least distinguishable (rc=128)
    #   - a STALE one answers CONFIDENTLY AND WRONGLY: `--is-ancestor` returns 0
    #     for the stale tip, the check reads "adds nothing", and the pull then
    #     lands every commit gained since. Resolve-after-fetch is too late, and
    #     refuse-when-unresolvable never fires because the ref does resolve.
    #   - `ls-remote` is ~1.4 s per PreToolUse call and FAILS OFFLINE, which for
    #     a fail-closed gate means "no pull on a protected branch without a
    #     network".
    #
    # So: gate every pull except the one form that cannot land foreign content.
    # Refspec-free means the target is the configured upstream by construction,
    # and --ff-only means git itself refuses if it is not a fast-forward. Both
    # are readable BEFORE the fetch, which is the constraint that defeated
    # everything else.
    #
    # NAMED RESIDUAL FALSE POSITIVE: a bare `git pull` on a cleanly
    # fast-forwardable protected branch is gated. That is deliberate — the
    # remedy is "use git pull --ff-only", a one-word fix and the safer command,
    # not a multi-minute gate run. Gating only refspec-bearing pulls would leave
    # bare `git pull` with divergent local history creating a real merge commit

# v2.4.0 (A6, found live merging PR #75) -- THE ARTIFACT CHECK BELOW COMPARES
# THE ARTIFACT TO **HEAD**, AND HEAD IS THE MERGE CONTENT ONLY ON SOME
# TOPOLOGIES. A controller sitting on `main` merges the PR BRANCH's tip, not
# HEAD; so "re-run the gate on the current head" gates content that is already
# merged, writes a green artifact, and then permits a merge of entirely
# different content -- a correct guard whose own remediation manufactures the
# false receipt. A flow of branch -> commit -> gate -> push -> PR -> merge has
# the controller ON the branch, where `artifact.sha == branch tip == merged
# content` and the same check is sound. Same hook, opposite validity.
#
# The split is purely local -- no API, no network, and both helpers are already
# in this hook: if the merge is initiated while HEAD is on a PROTECTED branch,
# the thing being merged is BY CONSTRUCTION not HEAD, so the comparison below
# verifies nothing. Say so and refuse; on a feature branch, fall through to the
# comparison, which is meaningful there.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT UNCONDITIONALLY FAIL-CLOSED. Target resolvability varies by
# path: `git merge <ref>` resolves locally, the MCP merge tools carry
# pullNumber/owner/repo (identified, but needing an API call), and a bare
# `gh pr merge` names no target at all. Refusing on every unresolvable path
# hard-blocks every PR merge for anyone offline -- the "unconditional
# fail-closed blocks everything" hazard from the GC_CMD round. The
# protected-branch detector is what makes cannot-determine-must-refuse
# affordable here: it refuses exactly the case where the evidence is known to
# be irrelevant, and stays out of the way otherwise.
