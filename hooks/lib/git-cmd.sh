# hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh
#
# Shared command parsing for the v2.0 git-native PreToolUse gates
# (pre-commit-test.sh, no-push-main.sh, gate-before-merge.sh).
#
# v1.x keyed those gates on MCP tool names because a blanket hook banned Bash git
# outright. v2.0 allows the native git/gh CLI, so the gates parse
# tool_input.command instead.
#
# Design notes:
#   - Matching is UNANCHORED inside each segment and quotes are stripped, so
#     wrapper payloads (bash -c "...", pwsh -Command "...") are covered. A false
#     positive (echo "git push origin main") is accepted: these gates fail closed.
#   - `<cwd>/.claude/git-guard-off` is the escape hatch for all three gates.
#   - v2.2.0: the payload is read through hooks/lib/json.sh (node, python3 or
#     jq). With NO parser on PATH the gates fail CLOSED — see gc_read_stdin.
#   - v2.2.1: three more ways a gate could not determine the answer, all of
#     which used to resolve to "allow" and now resolve to "refuse":
#     an unparseable payload (gc_read_stdin), a parser that is present but
#     broken (json.sh's json_probe_ok), and an unreplaced `{{...}}`
#     config value (gc_is_placeholder).
#
# WHY THESE GATES SCAN THE WHOLE STRING, and why enforce-delegation.sh does the
# opposite: these three are fail-CLOSED security gates, so an unanchored match
# is correct — `bash -c "git push origin main"` must not evade them, and a false
# positive on `echo "git push origin main"` costs one retry. enforce-delegation
# is fail-OPEN workflow policy, where a false DENY costs real work and no safety
# argument justifies it, so ITS patterns are anchored to command position. Do
# not "fix" these three the same way; the polarity is the whole difference.
#
# EXIT-CODE CONVENTIONS for the gates and the gate runner (v2.2.5). All four
# meanings in one place, because the fourth only makes sense against the others:
#
#     0    pass / not applicable — the tool call proceeds. NOTE it is OVERLOADED
#          at the success end and deliberately so: run-gate.sh also exits 0 when
#          the gate DID NOT RUN (no Gate field, no Gate command matched, or the
#          value is still a {{...}} placeholder), and pre-commit-test.sh cannot
#          tell those from "ran and passed". Documented as intentional, but know
#          the shape: v2.2.4's BOM bug is exactly the mechanism that makes it
#          live — a `**Gate**:` key that stops matching falls to the no-command
#          arm, exits 0, and every commit sails through looking clean. Not in
#          scope for v2.2.5; stated here so the next person adding a code sees
#          the whole picture rather than half of it.
#     2    BLOCK. Retrying after fixing the reported failure can succeed.
#    78    BLOCK, TERMINAL — retrying cannot change the outcome. `GC_TERMINAL_RC`
#          below.
#
#          78 MEANS TERMINAL. THE sysexits NAME IS A COINCIDENCE, NOT A REASON.
#          An earlier draft justified the number as EX_CONFIG ("configuration
#          error"). That argument is withdrawn twice over. First, the class is
#          wider than configuration: the self-reference guard IS a config error,
#          but "not inside a git repository" and a consumer's missing-dependency
#          preflight are ENVIRONMENT errors. All three are terminal — retrying
#          changes none of them — and only one is a config error, so anyone
#          checking the number against sysexits.h and concluding two codes are
#          needed would re-fragment the class this exists to unify. Second, a
#          DOCUMENTED code is MORE likely to collide, not less, because other
#          sysexits-aware programs emit 78 for its documented meaning. Which is
#          the point below.
#
#          THE CLAMP IS WHAT MAKES 78 SAFE, AND THE NUMBER NEVER WAS. A hook
#          NEVER forwards a child's exit code. run-gate.sh runs an arbitrary
#          consumer gate command; if that command exits 78 for its own reasons,
#          forwarding it would hand a plain test failure the terminal remedy
#          text ("edit your **Gate** value") — INVERTED advice, strictly worse
#          than the generic retry line it replaced. So run-gate.sh clamps a
#          gate command's 78 to 1. Anything that starts capturing `$?` and
#          exiting it verbatim opens that channel; do not.
#   127    the HOOK script did not run — its file is missing or its interpreter
#          is unreadable, so the harness never got a verdict out of it. This is
#          why every hook registration is 127-wrapped: an un-run gate must not
#          read as a pass.
#
# THAT LAST LINE IS ABOUT HOOKS, AND ONLY ABOUT HOOKS (v2.2.5). Do not carry it
# across to a CHECKER you invoke yourself. `bash -n <file>` returning 127 is
# bash's own verdict *about the file it was handed* — "No such file or
# directory" — so there it is a hard ERROR naming a missing script, never a
# shrug. Reading it as "did not run" would wave through `bash -n
# hooks/deleted-thing.sh`, which is precisely the condition the wrapper above
# exists to catch. The distinction is the direction of the call: 127 arriving
# FROM the harness means our script was not launched; 127 arriving from a child
# we launched ourselves is that child's answer. See the verdict table in
# user-level-reference/skills/sync-template/SKILL.md step 4.
#
# WHY 78 EXISTS (v2.2.5, consumer report). `run-gate.sh`'s RUN_GATE_ACTIVE guard
# fires correctly when a project's **Gate** value is `bash hooks/run-gate.sh`,
# and then the outer layers buried its accurate one-line diagnosis under two
# generic failures that BOTH said "fix the failures and re-run" — advice to
# retry the one thing that cannot succeed. The defect was not the wording: the
# caller had no way to tell a terminal failure from a retryable one. So the
# distinction is carried in the exit code, and every outer handler suppresses
# its retry advice on GC_TERMINAL_RC *structurally* — it never matches on a
# message or names a particular guard, so the next terminal guard inherits the
# behaviour by exiting 78 and nothing else has to change.
#
# A guard that fires correctly and then prints misleading remediation is not
# much better than one that does not fire. Whatever prints a terminal failure
# ends with the SPECIFIC remedy, and prints no generic "re-run" line at all.
#
# THE BRANCH IS THE FIX; THE NUMBER IS ONLY A NAME. run-gate.sh's
# self-reference guard has exited a distinct, non-generic code (2) since v2.1.3
# and NO outer handler ever read it — before v2.2.5 no script in hooks/ captured
# `$?` into a variable or compared an exit code against anything at all. The
# advice was circular not because the code was indistinguishable but because
# nothing looked at it. So the load-bearing half of this change is
# pre-commit-test.sh and gate-before-merge.sh LEARNING TO BRANCH; renaming 2 to
# 78 while the callers still test truthiness would have been the most expensive
# possible no-op. The rename is still right, for the correct reason: 2 is
# already the hooks' own BLOCK code, so the moment anything does branch, an
# ordinary block and a terminal gate would be indistinguishable.
#
# 78 IS AN INTERNAL SIGNAL AND NEVER A HOOK'S OWN EXIT STATUS. The harness
# treats every non-zero, non-2 PreToolUse exit as a NON-BLOCKING error and lets
# the tool call proceed — so a hook that *exits* 78 warns and ALLOWS. run-gate.sh
# may return 78 to its caller because it is a runner, not a hook;
# pre-commit-test.sh and gate-before-merge.sh must still exit 2 when they block
# and use the 78 only to choose which remediation text to print.
#
# Source it from a hook:  . "$(dirname "$0")/lib/git-cmd.sh"

# The standalone hooks/run-gate.sh repeats this literal (it must run with no
# JSON parser on PATH, which sourcing this file forbids);
# scripts/verify-template-consistency.sh asserts the two copies agree.

# Word-boundary-safe prefix for a git invocation: ANY sequence of global option

#
# v3.0.3, FINDING 62 — THIS CONSTANT WAS A THREE-GATE FAIL-OPEN. Until now it
# tolerated `-C <path>` and `-c <k>=<v>` and NOTHING ELSE, so a single common
# global made gc_matches_subcommand return false, and the subcommand was never
# FOUND. Measured on four hosts, three variants, on a protected branch:
#
#   git --no-pager merge feature/y            ALLOWED   (control: git merge -> 2)
#   git --no-pager push origin main           ALLOWED   past BOTH git gates
#   git --no-optional-locks merge feature/y   ALLOWED
#   git --literal-pathspecs push origin main  ALLOWED
#   git -P merge feature/y                    ALLOWED   (three characters)
#   git -P commit -m x                        no test run, 0 s, exit 0
#   control: git -C . merge --ff-only origin/main -> 2, via the -C tolerance
#
# All three callers exited 0 having evaluated NOTHING: gate-before-merge,
# no-push-main and pre-commit-test. Fixing it per hook would have been three
# copies of one fix and the third caller would have got none, so it is fixed
# here, once.
#
# MATCHING IS NOT ALLOWING. This constant answers "is this segment a `git <sub>`
# invocation at all"; whether the globals in front of it are acceptable is
# gc_global_options' separate question. An INERT global must lead to the normal
# verdict, never to a skip — `git --paginate merge feature/y` is found here and
# then refused by the merge arm, which is the point.
#
# The two-token forms are listed first so the alternation consumes an option's
# VALUE with it; the trailing `-[^[:space:]]+` arm then covers every one-token
# global, including ones git has not shipped yet.

# as a6_global_options until finding 62 showed no-push-main and pre-commit-test
# need the same classification; one definition, three callers.
#
# A gated git command is `[ENV...] git <globals> <subcommand> ...`. Every global
# before the subcommand is classified by ONE question: does it change what the
# command RESOLVES to? -c/--config-env (config), --git-dir/--work-tree (repo),
# --namespace (ref namespace — reads like a display option, moves the refs the
# decision is made from), --exec-path (which binaries run), --no-replace-objects
# (object resolution). Unknown globals are REFUSED: a future flag cannot
# silently join the allow side. -C is allowed because the callers resolve it.
#
# Complete over the config channel, measured (git 2.55.0): `git pull -c x=y`,
# `git merge -c`, `git push -c` all fail with `unknown switch`, so there is no
# after-the-subcommand position to have a gap in.
#
# THE SIX INERT GLOBALS ARE NOT A CONVENIENCE. --no-optional-locks is what VS
# Code and the JetBrains IDEs pass to avoid touching the index lock; refusing
# tooling nobody typed is the shape that gets a guard switched off.
#
# KNOWN SEAM: gc_segments strips quotes, so a `-C "C:/a b"` path word-splits
# here and the token after `-C` is consumed as its value while the remainder
# falls to the `*)` (subcommand) arm, printing `ok`. That is the same verdict
# the pre-v3.0.3 code gave, so this does not widen it; gc_matches_subcommand's

#
# THE 14th FAIL-OPEN (v2.2.6 round 2). All three gates carried a bare
# `[ -n "$GC_CMD" ] || exit 0`: a fail-OPEN guard on a fail-CLOSED gate. NO
# DEFECT WAS EVER OBSERVED IN THE FIELD — the "intermittently empty GC_CMD"
# once reported here is RETRACTED, along with the timing that appeared to show
# it (a PreToolUse hook completes BEFORE the Bash tool runs the command, so a
# timer inside the command cannot observe it; see
# .superpowers/sdd/sync-feedback/empty-payload-failopen.md). What stands is the
# STATE, found by reading this code: `command` key present, read yields nothing,
# gate exits 0. In a gate, an unreadable input is a block, never a pass. The fix
# is mechanism-agnostic because every sub-cause below warrants the same refusal.
#
# THE POLARITY IS NOT FLIPPED UNCONDITIONALLY, and that is the whole design. An
# unconditional refusal on an empty GC_CMD would block every legitimate Bash
# payload that carries no command at all — a hard block traded for a silent gap,
# strictly worse. Of the three states, two are ALREADY fail-closed and only the
# third is live:
#
#   stdin empty or unreadable   -> gc_read_stdin exits 2 (json_valid treats
#                                  empty stdin as INVALID, deliberately).
#   no JSON parser on PATH      -> gc_read_stdin exits 2.
#   payload parsed, GC_CMD ""   -> HERE. It splits three ways:
#
#     tool is not Bash/PowerShell   -> GC_CMD is "" BY DESIGN. Allow.
#     no `command` key at all       -> a legitimate Bash payload carrying no
#                                      command (see the note in gc_read_stdin
#                                      and the shipped "Bash payload with no
#                                      command" fixtures). Allow.
#     a `command` key IS present and
#     the read still yielded ""     -> the gate cannot do its job on a real
#                                      invocation. REFUSE.
#
# So this is NARROWER than "missing or empty": an ABSENT key still allows,
# because making that refuse would hard-block a documented, fixture-covered
# legitimate case. Only "present but unreadable" refuses.
#
# THE KEY PROBE IS A GREP OVER THE RAW PAYLOAD, not a json.sh call — the same
# reason json_session greps: the state being detected is one where the parser
# has already returned nothing, so asking it again proves nothing. It is also
# backend-invariant, so it answers identically in all three parser
# configurations. A false positive needs an unreadable command AND the literal
# `"command":` in some other field of the same payload, and it fails CLOSED,
# which is the correct direction for these three gates.
#
# GC_TOOL EMPTY IS DELIBERATELY INCLUDED in the matched set. These gates are
# registered on Bash|PowerShell, so an empty tool_name on a live invocation is

# v3.0.3 DEFECT 2 (security fix). The pre-existing arm below (`gc_resolve`,
# byte-identical back through v3.0.0) matched only `/*` and `[A-Za-z]:[/\\]*`
# as "absolute" and treated everything else, including `~/x` and `$HOME/x`,
# as a plain relative path tested against <base> -- which is almost always
# false, so it silently fell back to <base>. That is a STRICT SUPERSET of
# git's own unresolvable set: the real shell expands `~` and `$VAR` before
# git ever sees them, so `git -C ~/protected push` was judged against the
# WRONG repo (the payload cwd) while landing in the REAL one -- a silent
# bypass, live since v3.0.0. v3.0.3's own new multi-`-C` refusal machinery
# (gc_dash_c_unresolved) then went the other way and refused a `~`/`$HOME`
# double-`-C` outright, even though git resolves it fine -- a false refusal,
# and "a denied legitimate command is the guard people switch off".
#
# CLASS 3 KEYS ON THE PRESENCE of a shell metacharacter ($, ~, $(, <(, >(, a
# backtick) -- NOT on whether that character would actually expand. The hook
# payload does not carry which shell ran the command (bash vs PowerShell vs
# cmd), so "would this expand" is unanswerable from here; "does this LOOK
# like something only the shell could resolve" is answerable and is the
# question this asks. Under bash `~` expands (the bypass this closes) and
# refusing it is correct; under PowerShell `~` is literal and git fails on
# its own, so refusing it there is harmless -- refusing something that would
# have failed regardless. Same rule, both directions, no per-shell arm needed.
#
# `%VAR%` (cmd.exe style) is left OUT of class 3 on purpose: bash and
# PowerShell both leave it as a literal string, git fails to chdir into it,
# and that is exactly the documented single-`-C` fallback (class 1).

# the first one. Two live holes, both measured at 0d7806e:
#
#   ORDER       `git -c a=b -C <protected repo> merge feature/y` from an
#               unprotected cwd -> 0. The leading `-c` defeats the regex,
#               gc_git_c returns EMPTY, and gc_repo_for falls back to the
#               payload cwd. From the protected cwd the same command returned 2
#               — by luck, not by judgement.
#   REPETITION  `head -1` takes the FIRST `-C`, so
#               `git -C <feature repo> -C <protected repo> push` resolved to the
#               feature repo and went ungated.
#
# FINDING 63 IS THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE v3.0.2 ARGV-PREFIX DEFECT: that one was
# blind to unlisted globals AFTER the subcommand position; `gc_git_c` was blind
# to listed globals BEFORE `-C`. Same lib, same shape, opposite direction.
#
# The globals are now WALKED: every token after `git` is consumed until the
# first non-option token, which is the subcommand. Stopping at the subcommand is
# load-bearing in the other direction too — `git commit -C <commit>` reuses a

# detection. Value-taking globals swallow their operand so that a value can

# REPEATED `-C` IS FOLDED IN ARGV ORDER (v3.0.3, defect 1). MEASURED, git
# 2.55.0 on this host: `-C` is repeatable and CUMULATIVE, each operand relative

# it ("fatal: cannot change to 'b'" for a sibling `b`), and `git -C /g/x -C /g/y
# rev-parse` resolves to `/g/y`. So an absolute second operand OVERRIDES and a
# relative second one COMPOSES.
#
# WHY THE FOLD LIVES HERE AND NOT AT A CALL SITE. v3.0.3's first pass put it in
# `a6_repo_for` in hooks/gate-before-merge.sh, on the stated grounds that
# touching this lib would drag the ~90-minute three-parser matrix into the

# v3.0.3 (the widened GC_GIT_PRE, gc_global_options moved in), so the matrix is
# already mandatory before the tag — and the local copy was wrong in the way a
# local copy is always wrong here: THREE hooks resolve a repo through this
# function and the copy fixed ONE of them, while the OTHER of the two rules
# (order) was in the lib and so was fixed in none.

# (v3.0.3 defect 2) -- the pre-fix `>= 2` guard below meant a single
# `-C ~/protected` was never even classified, which is exactly how the silent
# bypass reached gc_repo_for unchallenged.
#
# THE RULE, IN PRECEDENCE ORDER:
#
#   0. No `-C` at all -> "" (nothing to refuse; must stay true after removing
#      the old `>= 2` guard, or every -C-free command -- including this file's
#      OWN `git commit -F <file>` -- would be refused).
#   1. ANY operand classifies as class 3 (cannot-determine, see
#      gc_classify_c) -> "cannot-determine\n<that operand>", regardless of
#      how many `-C` there are or whether other operands resolve. This is
#      new, count-independent behaviour: a single unresolvable-by-string
#      operand is exactly the shape the hook must refuse rather than guess.
#   2. Otherwise, single `-C` -> "" always. A class-1 miss keeps the
#      documented exit-0 fallback (git fails on its own); a class-2 hit
#      RESOLVES (closing the bypass) and is judged as the real repo by
#      gc_repo_for, not refused.
#   3. Otherwise, multi `-C`, all class 1/2:
#        a. When the FINAL folded path resolves, it is judged AS GIT WOULD
#           RESOLVE IT — relative composes, absolute overrides. `git -C
#           <protected> -C <unprotected>` is therefore judged as the
#           UNPROTECTED repo and allowed, because that is where git lands.
#        b. Only when the final path does NOT resolve is the strictest
#           RESOLVED candidate judged (gc_resolve keeps the last resolved
#           partial): `git -C <protected> -C nope` is judged as the protected
#           repo. Git will fail on its own anyway, so nothing lands either
#           way.
#        c. Refusal ("unresolved\n<first operand>") only when NO candidate
#           resolves at all -- the cannot-determine-by-resolution case.
#
# The first draft refused any multi-`-C` fold with an unresolvable step. That
# was too blunt: a denied legitimate command is the guard people switch off.
#
# THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN CLASS-1-MISS AND CLASS-3 ON A SINGLE `-C` IS
# DELIBERATE. `git -C nope merge` (class 1, no such directory) keeps its
# documented exit 0 -- falling back to the cwd and letting git fail; nothing
# about that operand is ambiguous, it is simply absent. `git -C $(cat x)
# merge` (class 3) is refused even alone -- the hook genuinely cannot know
# what that resolves to, which is a different fact about the SAME position.

# gc_push_args <segment> -- everything after the `push` subcommand ("" if none).
#
# v3.0.3 DEFECT 1 (security fix). The regex form this replaced permitted at
# most ONE `-C` in its primary arm; a double `-C` failed it and fell to a
# GREEDY fallback (`sed -n 's/.*\bpush\b//p'`) that strips through the LAST
# word-bounded `push` in the segment. Any trailing token that merely CONTAINS
# "push" as a whole word carried that fallback past the real refspec:
# `--push-option=ci-skip`, `--receive-pack=/x/push`, `-o push-me`, or a
# refspec branch literally named `feature/push-fix:main`. Measured: from an
# unprotected cwd, `git -C /tmp/other -C <P, on a feature branch> push origin
# other:main --push-option=ci-skip` returned rc=0 through no-push-main.sh — a
# real push into protected main. This is a STRING-SUBSTITUTION-ONLY parser
# (no eval, no unquoted ~, no $(...), no sh -c) over the ALREADY-RECEIVED
# payload text; it never re-interprets the payload as a shell.
#
# FIX: walk the token stream POSITIONALLY, using the same global-option shapes
# gc_dash_c_list/gc_global_options recognise, and return everything after the
# FIRST token that IS EXACTLY `push` in subcommand position. The greedy
# fallback is deleted, not repaired -- there is no shape it covered that this
# walk does not also cover, see the note below.
#
# Unrecognised bare words are SKIPPED, not treated as an abort/subcommand
# boundary: gc_segments strips quote characters, so `git -C "C:/a b" push …`
# word-splits into `-C`, `C:/a`, `b`, `push`, … and the fragment `b` is not a
# global and is not `push`. Aborting there would silently regress the very
# case gc_matches_subcommand's own fallback exists for (a quoted `-C` path
# with a space) back into a push whose destination goes uninspected. Scanning
# past it and finding the real `push` token keeps that case covered while
# still being non-greedy: only the FIRST `push` token ends the scan.
