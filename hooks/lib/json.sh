#
# One JSON field reader for every enforcement hook.
#
# Why: until v2.2.0 the hooks parsed their stdin payload with `node -e`. Native
# Claude Code installs (and most WSL/Linux boxes that never installed a JS
# toolchain) have no `node`, so every `node -e` returned empty, every gate saw
# an empty command and exited 0 — the guards were silently inactive. Reported
# 2026-08-29 from a WSL dry run.
#
# Backends, in order: node, python3, jq. All three read the payload from STDIN
# (never argv, which has platform length caps) and print the value with no
# trailing newline.
#
# v2.2.1: a backend is PROBED before it is trusted (json_probe_ok). Being on
# PATH is not evidence that a thing works — Windows ships a non-functional
# `python3` stub on PATH by default — and a broken parser was indistinguishable
# from an absent field, which put the git gates back on the fail-OPEN path the
# whole of v2.2.0 exists to close.
#
# Source it from a hook:  . "$(dirname "$0")/lib/json.sh"

JSON_PARSER=""

# A UTF-8 BOM. Claude Code does not emit one, but a payload that has been
# round-tripped through a Windows tool can carry it, and it makes every backend
# fail to parse — stripped once here rather than three times below.

# Not called directly by hooks; json_get picks the backend. Split out of
# json_get in v2.2.1 so json_parser can PROBE a backend before trusting it.

# platform most of this toolkit's users are on. A missing parser is detected; a
# broken one was not.

# but extracts the wrong thing is no more usable than one that crashes.

# was empty again on the next call — roughly five probe forks per git-gate run
# on a Bash|PowerShell matcher, not the "one, on first use" the comment claimed.
# Cheap while the probe was a `command -v` builtin; not cheap now that it execs
# an interpreter. So the callers below call THIS in their own shell and read
# $JSON_PARSER, and `json_parser` stays as the printing wrapper for the few
# places that want the name. gc_read_stdin's json_have call runs in the hook's
# top-level shell, so the later `$(json_get …)` subshells inherit the resolved
