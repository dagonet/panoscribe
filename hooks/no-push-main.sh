# a false positive. The counting bug is inside gc_has_refspec in
# hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh; it is compensated here, at the call site, because that
# lib is covered by the ~90-minute three-parser matrix and this shape carries no
# JSON. Same reason gate-before-merge.sh carries its own copy as
# a6_strip_redir: the duplication is deliberate and small.
#
# NOT GREEDY, and that is the point: dropping everything after a `>` would turn
# `git push origin main 2>&1` into a refspec-free push and lose the explicit
# protected destination. Only a token that is ITSELF a redirection operator is
# dropped — with its target attached (`2>&1`, `>file`), or bare (`>`, `2>`)
# plus exactly the one token that follows it. The empty-token arm is first
# because `tr` emits an empty field for a double space, which would otherwise
# consume the skip and leak the redirect target back in as an operand.
