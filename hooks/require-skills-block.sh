# PreToolUse hook: require '## Required Skills' block in spawn prompts for
# bound subagent_types.
#
# Matcher: Agent   (was `Task`. The header said Task until v3.0.0 while
#                   settings.json registered Agent, and that drift is the trail
#                   to a hook that had never fired — see the field-path note.)
#
# Enforces `AGENT_TEAM.md` §Spawn-Prompt Binding Table. When the PO spawns
# a Task whose subagent_type is in the binding table, the prompt body MUST
# contain a literal '## Required Skills' line. Subagent types not in the
# table pass through. The 'code-reviewer' type has no required skills and
# also passes through.
#
# DRIFT WARNING: the case statement below duplicates the binding table in
# templates/general/AGENT_TEAM.md §Superpowers Skills Integration. The
# scripts/verify-template-consistency.sh script diffs the two and fails
# CI if they diverge — keep them in sync.
#
# Reference: docs/plans/2026-04-12-wire-superpowers-skills.md (Chunk B,
# §Architecture). Reads its payload through hooks/lib/json.sh, the shared
# node/python3/jq reader the git gates use.

# ⚠ NAMED `HOOK_PAYLOAD`, NOT `TOOL_INPUT`, AND THE RENAME IS THE POINT.
# Until v3.0.0 this held the WHOLE stdin document while being called
# `TOOL_INPUT`, and the string `tool_input` appeared nowhere in the file. That
# is why the dead-hook defect below survived review: `json_get "$TOOL_INPUT"
# subagent_type` reads perfectly as "get subagent_type from the tool input", so
# an auditor confirms the intent and moves on. The variable was named for an
# extraction that was never performed.
HOOK_PAYLOAD=$(cat)

# v2.2.0: fields are read through hooks/lib/json.sh (node, python3 or jq).
# Fail-open with one WARN when none of the three is on PATH.

# ⚠ THE FIELDS ARE NESTED UNDER `tool_input`, AND READING THEM AT THE TOP LEVEL
# MEANT THIS HOOK HAD NEVER FIRED (v3.0.0).
#
# Measured two ways. A payload in the harness's real shape exited 0 for a BOUND
# subagent_type with no `## Required Skills` block; the same payload with the
# fields flattened exited 2. And on the real harness, a bound `architect` spawn
# with no skills block LAUNCHED. So `SUBAGENT_TYPE` was always empty, every
# spawn fell to the `*)` default arm, and the hook exited 0 on every spawn ever
# made.
#
# Every other hook in this repo already reads nested — `hooks/lib/git-cmd.sh`
# takes `tool_input.command`, `hooks/enforce-delegation.sh` takes
# `j.tool_input`. This one was the only top-level reader, and the trail is the
# stale `# Matcher: Task` header above: the field paths were written against the
# old tool's payload and the matcher was renamed to `Agent` without them.
#
# WHY THE SUITE DID NOT CATCH IT: `mkspawn()` in scripts/test-hooks.sh builds a
# FLAT payload, so every existing fixture exercised a shape the harness does not
# send. The nested-shape fixtures added in v3.0.0 are the control that would
# have.
#
# ⚠ WHY THIS IS A v3.0.0 BLOCKER AND NOT A FAST FOLLOW: in the five-binding-form
# taxonomy this hook's `case` arms are form 1 — FAIL OPEN, SILENT. v3.0.0
# consolidates 13 agent names to 10. The mechanism meant to catch a mis-bound
# name after that consolidation is the mechanism that has never run, so the
# rename would ship and the detector would stay silent for the same reason it
# has always been silent.
#
# WHY THE DESCENT IS HERE AND NOT AT THE `$(cat)` ABOVE. Extracting the whole
# `tool_input` OBJECT once, then reading scalars out of it, would be the tidier
# shape — but `hooks/lib/json.sh` cannot do it. MEASURED against the shipped
# reader (node parser):
#
#   json_get "$P" tool_input                 -> []            <- empty
#   json_get "$P" tool_input.subagent_type   -> [architect]
#
# `json_get` returns SCALARS; a sub-object comes back as the empty string, which
# would make the fallback below fire on every payload and restore the exact
# defect. So the descent is expressed as a dotted PATH at the point of use,
# which the reader does support, and the variable above is renamed so it no
# longer claims a descent that never happened.
#
# The top-level read is KEPT as a fallback, deliberately: the live Agent payload
# cannot be observed from inside the suite, so reading both shapes is correct
# under either and cannot regress. Nested wins when both are present.
#
# ⚠ DO NOT "FIX" hooks/enforce-agent-contract.sh BY ANALOGY. It reads
# `agent_type`, `agent_id` and `agent_transcript_path` off the top level with no
# `tool_input` descent, which looks like the same defect and is not: it is a
# SubagentStop hook, and those fields ARE top-level in that event. Changing it
# would break a working hook while fixing a dead one.

  # DELIBERATELY EXEMPT — v2.4.0 (item A5) MADE THIS SET EXPLICIT, and the
  # names are the whole point of the change. Until now `ops` and `Explore`
  # reached the `*)` arm below, which is BYTE-IDENTICAL IN EFFECT to this one:
  # an agent exempted on purpose and an agent whose name silently fell out of
  # the enumeration produced the same `exit 0`, with no signal at runtime or
  # afterwards that distinguished them. A consumer could not tell whether their
  # own `game-tester` was unbound deliberately or by accident.
  #
  # THE OBVIOUS FIX — make `*)` warn — IS UNAVAILABLE, and this programme has
  # already paid for the lesson: a hook that exits 0 has no reliable channel to
  # the transcript, and hook stderr was measured not to reach the lead. A
  # warning nobody receives is the same silence with more code, and it reads as
  # fixed. So the intent is written down HERE, as arm labels, and
  # scripts/verify-template-consistency.sh check 29 asserts statically — in the
  # gate, where output demonstrably reaches someone — that every SHIPPED agent
  # name matches a binding arm or appears on this list. Deleting or renaming an
  # agent without updating this file is red before the release ships.
  #
  # ADDING A NAME HERE IS A DECISION, NOT A TIDY-UP: it says this agent needs
  # no skills block. Do not add a name here to silence check 29 — the check
  # exists to make that decision visible.
  #
  # v3.0.0 (item B2): `doc-generator` LEFT THIS ARM BY BEING ABSORBED INTO
  # `coder`, not by falling out of it — and the difference is the whole reason
  # this list exists. Docs are now a `coder` spawn, which IS bound, so doc work
  # now carries the coder skills. Check 29 arm A is what makes the distinction
  # mechanical: had the agent files been deleted without editing this arm, the
  # gate would be red before the release shipped.
