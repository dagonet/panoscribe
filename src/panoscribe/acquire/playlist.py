"""Playlist / channel URL expansion via yt-dlp metadata-only extraction.

Sprint 8.1: feeds the per-line URL list of ``transcribe-many`` through this
module before reconcile so that a single playlist URL becomes the list of its
constituent video URLs, in feed order.

The single public entry point :func:`expand_playlist` returns:

- ``list[str]``: one URL per video for a recognised playlist / channel,
  in yt-dlp's natural feed order.
- ``None``: input is a single-video URL, a local file path / non-URL string,
  or any extraction error (DownloadError, ExtractorError, network /
  SSL-level failure, malformed response). Callers treat ``None`` as
  "not a playlist — keep the original line".

    Behaviour:

    - Local-file / non-URL detection is scheme-based: any ``url`` that does
      not start with ``http://`` or ``https://`` returns ``None`` without
      touching yt-dlp (deterministic on Windows backslash paths and on
      Linux absolute paths that may or may not exist).
    - For http(s) URLs, runs ``YoutubeDL.extract_info`` with ``extract_flat``
      so only metadata is fetched (no video download).
    - If the response's ``_type`` is not exactly ``"playlist"``, returns
      ``None`` — single-video URLs flow through the per-video pipeline
      unchanged.
    - Entries are coerced via ``list(info.get("entries") or [])`` to handle
      yt-dlp's ``LazyList`` return shape.
    - Each entry is resolved via :func:`_entry_to_url`. Entries without any
      resolvable URL are dropped + logged at WARNING.
    - Empty playlists return ``[]`` (caller will splice nothing in place).
    - Any exception during extraction → WARNING log + ``None``. Returning
      ``None`` rather than raising lets the caller treat extraction failures
      identically to "not a playlist": the original URL passes through to
      the per-video pipeline, which surfaces the actual extractor error.
    - One level of expansion only: nested ``_type == "playlist"`` entries are
      treated as opaque single URLs (no recursion).
