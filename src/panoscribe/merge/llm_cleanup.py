"""Opt-in, Ollama-backed per-segment LLM cleanup (Sprints 6.1 + 6.2).

Public entry points:

- :func:`cleanup_ocr_segments` (Sprint 6.1) — fixes OCR artefacts on
  ``ON-SCREEN`` and ``BOTH`` segments. Emits log lines prefixed
  ``"LLM cleanup:"``.
- :func:`cleanup_speech_segments` (Sprint 6.2) — fixes punctuation and
  capitalization on ``SPEECH`` segments only. Emits log lines prefixed
  ``"LLM ASR cleanup:"``.

**Target-source partitioning is disjoint by design:** ``BOTH`` is claimed by
the OCR pass (Phase-4 collapse can leak OCR artefacts into the merged text);
``SPEECH`` is claimed by the ASR pass. A single segment is never sent through
both prompts, which keeps the cross-function invariant simple: run both
cleanups sequentially on a mixed batch and every segment is modified at most
once, with its ``source`` field never mutated.

Both functions run after :func:`panoscribe.output.merge_channels` and before
:class:`panoscribe.output.Transcript` construction.

**Log-prefix asymmetry (historical):** ``cleanup_ocr_segments`` emits
``"LLM cleanup: ..."`` (shipped unchanged since 6.1). ``cleanup_speech_segments``
emits ``"LLM ASR cleanup: ..."`` (introduced in 6.2). The OCR prefix stayed
unchanged to honour the sprint-6.2 zero-touch-to-6.1 principle — renaming
would have forced edits to the 13 existing 6.1 tests and risked byte drift.

The ``ollama`` dependency is imported at module top via ``try/except
ImportError`` so (a) users who don't install the ``[llm]`` extras never see
an ``ImportError`` at CLI startup; (b) tests can patch
``panoscribe.merge.llm_cleanup.Client`` directly. Function-local lazy imports
would hide ``Client`` from ``unittest.mock.patch`` because the bound name
wouldn't exist at module scope.

The no-op short-circuit in each function (empty input, or no segments with
the function's target source) returns before any network call.
