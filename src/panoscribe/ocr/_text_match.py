"""Private text-matching primitives shared across OCR pipeline stages.

Both :mod:`panoscribe.ocr.deduplicator` (cross-frame clustering) and
:mod:`panoscribe.ocr.ui_filter` (frequency-filter clustering) need the
same notion of "are these two OCR strings the same overlay?". A single
shared helper keeps the two stages from drifting on whitespace /
case-folding / similarity-threshold semantics — a kind of subtle
inconsistency that bites users when noise gets through.

The module is private (``_``-prefixed) — these helpers are an
implementation detail of the OCR pipeline, not a public API.

Both helpers are pure functions; no I/O, no logging, no global state.
