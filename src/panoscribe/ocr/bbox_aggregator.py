"""Per-frame bounding-box aggregation for RapidOCR results.

Groups same-line bboxes into a single canonical caption string per text
region per frame, *before* cross-frame deduplication runs. RapidOCR returns
text at the word/region level; without this stage a visible caption like
``KEINE KAMPFSPORTTECHNIK KEINE`` produces three separate point segments per
frame and downstream text-similarity dedup never clusters them.

Pure function — no side effects, no I/O, no logging. Caller is responsible
for confidence-threshold semantics (passed in as ``min_confidence``).

Algorithm (per frame):
    1. Drop bboxes whose individual ``score < min_confidence``.
    2. Drop intra-frame duplicate-text bboxes (overlapping detections of
       the same word) — keep first occurrence.
    3. Compute axis-aligned ``y_min``/``y_max``/``x_min``/``x_max`` from each
       polygon's four corners; derive ``y_center``, ``x_center``, ``box_height``.
    4. Compute frame-wide ``mean_height`` over surviving boxes; this is the
       tolerance baseline for line grouping (more robust than per-line running
       mean, which is fragile if the first bbox is a tiny icon).
    5. Sort by ``y_center``; walk the list joining boxes whose
       ``abs(y_center - line.y_center_running_mean) <= 0.5 * mean_height``
       to the current line, otherwise start a new line. ``<=`` is inclusive —
       a delta exactly equal to the tolerance joins the current line.
    6. Within each line, sort by ``x_center`` for left-to-right reading order.
    7. Emit one ``(joined_text, mean_confidence)`` tuple per line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes:
        Sequence of 4-corner polygons; each polygon is a sequence of four
        ``(x, y)`` tuples (RapidOCR's rotated-rectangle output, used here as
        an axis-aligned bounding rectangle for grouping).
    texts:
        Per-bbox text strings; ``len(texts) == len(boxes)``.
    scores:
        Per-bbox confidence scores in ``[0.0, 1.0]``; ``len(scores) == len(boxes)``.
    min_confidence:
        Bboxes with ``score < min_confidence`` are dropped *before* grouping
        (mirrors the per-bbox confidence semantics of the pre-aggregation
        loop). A line never inherits a low-confidence word.
    y_tolerance_ratio:
        Multiplier on ``frame_mean_height`` used as the y-delta tolerance
        for joining a bbox to the current line. Default ``0.5`` means a
        bbox joins if its ``y_center`` is within half the mean line height
        of the running line center.
    x_gap_tolerance_ratio:
        Multiplier on ``frame_mean_height`` used as the x-gap threshold
        for splitting a same-y-line group into separate column chunks.
        Word/phrase gaps are typically 0.2-0.6x text height; column gutters
        are 3-5x. Default ``2.0`` keeps word gaps joined while splitting
        column gutters. Strict ``>`` — a gap exactly at threshold stays
        joined. Negative gaps (overlapping boxes) never split.

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple[str, float]]
        One ``(joined_text, mean_confidence)`` tuple per detected text chunk,
        in top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading order. Within each line, words
        with gap > ``x_gap_tolerance_ratio * mean_height`` produce separate
        chunks. Empty input returns an empty list.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If ``len(boxes) != len(texts)`` or ``len(boxes) != len(scores)`` —
        this is a RapidOCR contract violation; failing fast here is safer
        than silently truncating to the shortest sequence.
