"""Cross-frame OCR deduplicator.

Collapses near-duplicate ON-SCREEN segments (same overlay held across multiple
sampled frames) into a single segment spanning ``[first.start, last.end]``.
SPEECH segments pass through unchanged.

Design
------

* **Pure function.** No config access, no I/O, no logging. Callers pass in the
  similarity threshold, minimum duration, and gap tolerance directly.
* **Gap tolerance is a caller concern.** Computed upstream from
  ``config.ocr_sample_fps`` (``2.0 / ocr_sample_fps`` in the CLI wiring) so
  this module is independent of sampling rate. This keeps the function purer
  than passing the whole ``PanoScribeConfig`` in.
* **Similarity metric.** ``rapidfuzz.fuzz.ratio / 100`` in ``[0.0, 1.0]``.
  Compared against the *tail* (most recent) member of the active cluster, not
  the first — keeps the cluster anchored to its current textual form if OCR
  mis-reads a character mid-run.
* **Grouping.** ON-SCREEN segments are first partitioned out of the input,
  then bucketed by a canonical text key (case-folded, stripped). Clustering
  walks each bucket in time order so same-text occurrences across non-
  consecutive input positions still collapse — handling the multi-region-per-
  frame case (top pill / mid pill / bottom caption interleaved in receipt
  order).
* **Ordering.** Output is sorted by ``start``. On equal-start ties, SPEECH
  precedes ON-SCREEN — this matches the downstream
  :func:`merge_channels` expectation.

    """Collapse near-duplicate ON-SCREEN runs; pass SPEECH through unchanged.

    ON-SCREEN segments with the same canonical text (case-folded, stripped) are
    clustered across the full input — they need not be consecutive in the input
    list. This handles the multi-region-per-frame case where each sampled frame
    yields several text regions (top pill, mid pill, bottom caption), so same-
    text occurrences across frames are interleaved with sibling regions in
    receipt order.

    Output is sorted by ``start``. Input order is **not** preserved. On equal
    ``start`` values, SPEECH segments precede ON-SCREEN segments in output,
    matching :func:`merge_channels`' downstream expectation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    segments:
        Mixed input list containing ``source="SPEECH"`` and
        ``source="ON-SCREEN"`` segments. Input order is not required to be
        time-sorted; the output sort makes that contract explicit.
    threshold:
        Minimum similarity (``[0.0, 1.0]``) between two ON-SCREEN segments'
        texts in the same canonical-key bucket for them to extend the active
        cluster. Computed as ``rapidfuzz.fuzz.ratio(a, b) / 100`` with
        ``processor=str.lower`` so case-variation within a bucket does not
        depress the score.
    min_duration:
        Minimum duration (``last.end - first.start``) for a collapsed cluster
        to survive. Shorter clusters are dropped entirely (useful to suppress
        single-frame flicker false positives).
    gap_tolerance:
        Maximum allowed gap (``current.start - cluster.last.end``) between
        consecutive ON-SCREEN segments **within the same canonical-key
        bucket**. Typically ``2.0 / ocr_sample_fps`` so a single missing frame
        does not break a held overlay into two segments. Identical text far
        apart in time still splits — text grouping does not bypass this guard.
