"""Sparse frame sampling for OCR inference.

OpenCV on Windows does not play well with :class:`pathlib.Path` (particularly
UNC paths), so every video path is coerced to ``str(Path.resolve())`` before
reaching ``cv2.VideoCapture``.

Sprint 2.5 adds pre-OCR **scene-change detection** via frame-to-frame pixel
mean-absdiff at a 320-longest-edge grayscale downscale. Frames near-identical
to the last yielded frame are skipped. First frame always yields; a bounded
max-gap forces periodic yields for slow gradient drift; an end-of-video rule
guarantees the final visible frame reaches OCR unless it is a pure duplicate.
Phase 2 behavior is recoverable via ``scene_change_enabled=False``.

    The sampler reads every native frame (cv2's only supported access pattern) and
    emits one frame per ``stride`` frames, where ``stride = max(1, round(native_fps / fps))``.
    End-of-stream (``cap.read() -> (False, _)``) is normal termination and does NOT
    raise. A capture that fails to open raises :class:`PanoScribeError`.

    With ``scene_change_enabled=True`` (default), stride-picked frames are further
    filtered against the previous yielded frame via grayscale mean-absdiff at a
    320-longest-edge downscale. Yield rules (evaluated in order):

    1. First stride-picked frame — always yield (cold start).
    2. ``_frame_difference >= scene_change_threshold`` — yield.
    3. ``frames_since_yield >= max_gap_frames`` — force-yield (bounded gap,
       ``max_gap_frames = max(1, round(fps * _MAX_GAP_SECONDS))``, fps-invariant
       in wall-clock terms).
    4. Else advance without yielding.

    After the read loop terminates, an end-of-video rule force-yields the final
    stride-picked frame iff its ``_frame_difference`` vs the last yielded frame
    is strictly greater than ``0.0`` (any non-zero pixel change). Pure duplicates
    are dropped.

    Args:
        video_path: Local video file. Converted to ``str(Path.resolve())`` before
            being handed to OpenCV.
        fps: Target sampling frequency in frames-per-second. Must be positive —
            enforced upstream by :class:`panoscribe.config.PanoScribeConfig`;
            sampler does not re-validate.
        scene_change_enabled: When ``False``, short-circuits the downscale + diff
            path entirely — every stride-picked frame yields (Phase 2 baseline).
        scene_change_threshold: Mean-absdiff threshold in ``(0.0, 1.0]`` above
            which a stride-picked frame is considered a scene change.

    Yields:
        ``(timestamp_seconds, bgr_frame)`` for each selected frame. ``timestamp_seconds``
        is derived from the source native FPS, not the cv2 per-frame timestamp
        property (which is unreliable for MP4s without presentation timestamps).
