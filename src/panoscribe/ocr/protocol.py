"""OCR engine protocol — structural subtyping for swappable backends.

Uses :class:`typing.Protocol` (not ABC) so a future vision-LLM backend
satisfies the interface by having the right methods and attributes, without
needing to inherit from a base class.  Marked ``@runtime_checkable`` so
``isinstance(engine, OcrEngine)`` works at runtime.

The method signatures mirror :class:`panoscribe.ocr.rapid_ocr.RapidOCREngine`
exactly — every backend must expose:
* ``extract(video_path, *, detected_language, funnel)``
* ``extract_images(image_paths, *, detected_language, funnel, timestamps)``
* ``last_frame_count`` (``int`` attribute, updated after each call)
