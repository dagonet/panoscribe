"""Pure-function UI filters for OCR segments.

Three independent helpers make up the Sprint 3.2 UI-filter stage:

* :func:`mask_zones` — zero out rectangular regions of a grayscale frame
  (defensive copy, pixel-rect clamped to the frame bounds; a no-op when the
  zone tuple is empty).
* :func:`filter_by_patterns` — drop ON-SCREEN segments whose text matches
  any compiled regex. SPEECH segments pass through untouched.
* :func:`filter_by_frequency` — drop ON-SCREEN segments whose normalised text
  appears in at least ``threshold`` of sampled frames, with a fuzzy
  near-duplicate clustering pass to catch the ``"SUBSCRIBE!"`` /
  ``"Subscribe →"`` / ``"SUBSCRIBE"`` family. SPEECH segments pass
  through. ``frame_count == 0`` short-circuits to the input unchanged.

Normalisation divergence (intentional)
--------------------------------------
``filter_by_patterns`` preserves case — regex authors opt into case
insensitivity via ``re.IGNORECASE``. ``filter_by_frequency`` case-folds
internally via :func:`panoscribe.ocr._text_match._canonical_key` because
UI chrome often flickers between ``"SUBSCRIBE"`` and ``"Subscribe"``
across frames and the ratio calculation would otherwise miss those
counts. The same helper is reused by the deduplicator so the two
stages cannot drift on case-folding semantics.

Ordering (binding)
------------------
The CLI must run :func:`filter_by_patterns` and :func:`filter_by_frequency`
on the **raw pre-dedup** OCR segments, not on post-dedup output. The
frequency ratio ``count / frame_count`` is only meaningful against raw
per-frame detections — dedup collapses duplicates and would trivialise the
ratio.

    Normalisation uses :func:`panoscribe.ocr._text_match._canonical_key`
    (case-folded, edge-stripped) so that variations like ``"SUBSCRIBE"``
    and ``"Subscribe"`` share a bucket. Beyond exact-key buckets, a second
    pass clusters near-duplicate keys (e.g. ``"SUBSCRIBE!"`` /
    ``"Subscribe →"`` / ``"SUBSCRIBE"``) using a greedy single-link walk
    against :func:`panoscribe.ocr._text_match._fuzzy_match` — a key joins
    an existing cluster if it matches *any* member of that cluster at
    ``fuzzy_threshold`` (in 0-100, the rapidfuzz ``fuzz.ratio`` scale).

    A segment is dropped when its **cluster's** combined occurrence count
    divided by ``frame_count`` is greater than or equal to ``threshold``.
    The fuzzy clustering raises the *effective* recurrence count for any
    canonical text — see the "Behavior-change risk" section in
    ``docs/plans/sprint-7-1-ocr-noise-floor.md``.

    SPEECH segments pass through untouched. ``frame_count == 0`` returns
    the input unchanged — the ratio is undefined and we must not divide
    by zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    segments:
        Mixed input list. SPEECH segments bypass filtering.
    frame_count:
        Total number of sampled frames the OCR ran over. Denominator
        for the recurrence ratio.
    threshold:
        Drop boundary (``[0.0, 1.0]``). A cluster is dropped when
        ``cluster_count / frame_count >= threshold``.
    fuzzy_threshold:
        Minimum ``fuzz.ratio`` (0-100) for two canonical keys to share a
        cluster. Default 90.0 — tight enough to keep legitimate captions
        apart, loose enough to collapse common SUBSCRIBE / handle / arrow
        variants.
    min_frame_count:
        Minimum ``frame_count`` required for the filter to run.  When
        ``0 < frame_count < min_frame_count`` the filter is skipped and the
        input list is returned unchanged (guard for short clips where even
        legitimate text clears the ratio threshold).  Default 0 = disabled,
        so existing callers see byte-identical behaviour.
