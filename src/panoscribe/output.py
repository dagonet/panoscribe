    Algorithm
    ---------
    For each SPEECH segment, find all OCR segments that temporally overlap it
    (inclusive rule: ``speech.start <= ocr.end AND ocr.start <= speech.end`` —
    touching boundaries DO overlap). Among overlapping OCR segments,
    compute ``rapidfuzz.fuzz.WRatio(speech.text, ocr.text)`` (returns 0-100).
    Any OCR meeting ``WRatio >= threshold * 100`` is a candidate to collapse
    with the speech segment. Pick the candidate with the highest WRatio
    (ties → earliest ``ocr.start``) and emit::

        TranscriptSegment(
            source="BOTH",
            text=speech.text,                     # whitespace-normalized
            start=min(speech.start, ocr.start),
            end=max(speech.end, ocr.end),
            confidence=speech.confidence,         # not max() — scales differ
            language=speech.language,
        )

    The chosen OCR segment is **consumed**; other overlapping OCR segments
    stay as ``[ON-SCREEN]``. Each OCR segment collapses at most once.

    Trade-offs
    ----------
    * **Lossy on collapse.** The emitted ``text`` is ``speech.text`` even when
      the OCR segment holds richer detail (e.g. speech: "as I mentioned";
      OCR: "AcmeCloud Enterprise v4.2"). Concatenating OCR onto speech would
      produce awkward output; users who need the OCR detail can read the
      consumed OCR segment (currently dropped — revisit if users report loss).
    * **``confidence=speech.confidence``.** Whisper confidence is log-prob
      derived; RapidOCR confidence is pixel-match derived. Mixing scales with
      ``max()`` would be meaningless. Since ``text`` is speech-sourced, the
      speech confidence is the consistent anchor.
    * **Whitespace normalized.** The merged text has internal ``\\n``/``\\r``
      and consecutive spaces collapsed to single spaces so downstream format
      writers (SRT, MD) don't corrupt on multi-line cues.

    Parameters
    ----------
    speech:
        SPEECH segments (ASR output).
    ocr:
        ON-SCREEN segments (post-dedup OCR output).
    threshold:
        Similarity floor in ``[0.0, 1.0]`` — scaled by 100 before comparison
        with ``WRatio``. ``0.85`` is the default from
        ``PanoScribeConfig.merge_similarity_threshold``.

    Returns
    -------

        speech is appended before OCR prior to the stable sort).
